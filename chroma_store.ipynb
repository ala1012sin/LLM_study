We can’t avoid every impact of climate \\nchange, but our infrastructure, public services, and residents are \\nprotected from the ravages of extreme weather. Every New Yorker \\nbenefits from these changes, which were undertaken in a fair way, \\nand our adapted city is a model for the world to follow. \\nIN 2050, NEW YORKERS NO LONGER RELY  \\nON CARS.\\nOur streets are safe and easy to navigate, reclaimed for people. \\nSubways and buses are fast and reliable, taking people where they \\nneed to go and connecting our city to the wider metropolitan \\nregion. Bicycle lanes abound and walking is a favorite way of \\ngetting around town. For many New Yorkers, the daily commute \\nto work is a scenic ferry ride. New modes of transportation, \\nenabled by technology and responsibly deployed, add to the \\nmobility options throughout the five boroughs.\\nIN 2050, NEW YORKERS ARE SECURE IN THEIR \\nHOMES AND NEIGHBORHOODS.\\nSafe, affordable housing is available in all five boroughs, and \\nour neighborhoods are more diverse and dynamic than ever. \\nCommunities are safe, the air and water are clean, and there are \\nabundant open spaces for all to enjoy. In every neighborhood, there \\nare cultural centers and libraries, small businesses and corner \\ngroceries open for late night shopping.

We \\nhave extreme wealth alongside dire poverty and \\nhomelessness. There is unmatched cultural and \\npopulation diversity amid some of the most racial-\\nly segregated urban neighborhoods in the United \\nStates. Our landmark skyscrapers are recognizable \\nworldwide, and towering high-rises are reshap-\\ning our skyline. Yet in many neighborhoods most \\nbuildings are just a few stories tall. \\nOur city gave rise to social justice movements and \\ninfluential figures fighting for equality, and our \\nstreets are hotbeds of public activism. But we are \\nstill confronting injustice and social and economic \\ninequities and a lack of faith in civic institutions. \\nNew York City’s subway system is one of the largest \\nin the world, but it is decaying due to neglect and \\ndisinvestment. We have hundreds of miles of ma-\\njestic waterfront, and a natural harbor, both built \\nfor commerce, but which now, in an era of climate \\nchange, are exposed and endangered.\\nTHESE CONTRADICTIONS EXIST AGAINST THE \\nBACKDROP OF NATIONAL AND INTERNATION-\\nAL POLITICAL TRENDS THAT HAVE LED TO \\nBROAD DISTRUST IN GOVERNMENT. There is a \\ndisturbing rise in nationalism, intolerance, and \\nauthoritarianism in many countries, including \\nours; this impacts New Yorkers personally, reflects \\na turning away from the values we hold dear, and \\ncontributes to voter apathy. Across the globe, \\ngovernments are failing to take necessary actions \\nto protect the climate, address economic inequi-\\nty, and secure basic human rights, requiring that \\nglobal cities such as New York take the lead and \\nform partnerships to address these issues. \\nAs we look to 2050, the challenges facing New \\nYork City are significant, but we have faced chal-\\nlenges of equal measure before and prevailed. \\nToday, we are stronger than at any time in our \\nhistory. In recent years, we have embraced pro-\\ngressive policies that address our most pressing \\nchallenges head-on. And as we look ahead, we are \\ncommitted to resolving our city’s contradictions \\nwithout compromising or relinquishing our lega-\\ncy of openness, inclusion, and progress. \\nWE STRIVE TO TRANSFORM OUR CITY FOR THE \\nFUTURE, BUILDING ON PAST ACHIEVEMENTS \\nAND USING OUR UNPARALLELED TALENT AND \\nRESOURCES AS AN ANTIDOTE.

Yet \\nwe also know there is much to be done to address critical \\nchallenges such as climate change, increasing unaffordabil-\\nity, and failing infrastructure that have been decades, if not \\ngenerations, in the making. Now we must go further. \\nThe following pages outline 30 strategic initiatives New \\nYork City will undertake to achieve this vision for 2050. \\nHIGHLIGHTS OF THE STRATEGY, WHICH LAY THE FOUN-\\nDATION FOR TRANSFORMATIONAL CHANGE, INCLUDE:\\n1. COMMITTING TO CARBON NEUTRALITY BY 2050,  \\nand a just transition that benefits all New Yorkers. We \\nwill be a leader among global cities by pursuing steep \\ncuts in greenhouse gas emissions from buildings and \\nsourcing 100 percent clean electricity, while creating \\ngreen jobs and holding polluters responsible for cli-\\nmate-related costs.\\n2. LEADING BY EXAMPLE ON CLIMATE CHANGE  by \\nending City purchases of unnecessary single-use plastic \\nfoodware and phasing out the purchase of processed \\nmeat, cutting beef purchasing in half, committing to a \\ncarbon neutral City fleet by 2040, pursuing expanding \\nmandatory organics collection citywide, and undertak-\\ning comprehensive projects to mitigate climate risk, \\nincluding Lower Manhattan Coastal Resiliency.\\n3. INTRODUCING CONGESTION PRICING, to reduce \\ntraffic in Manhattan and generate funds for essential \\nsubway repairs and enhancements, while dramati -\\ncally improving bus service through expanded and \\nimproved bus lanes, stronger bus lane enforcement, \\nand signal improvements that prioritize buses as they \\ntravel through city streets.\\n4. RECLAIMING STREETS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE \\nPUBLIC by creating People Priority Zones that restrict \\nvehicular access, create public spaces, improve safety, \\nreduce congestion, and improve air quality. We will \\nstart with a zone in Lower Manhattan to test a potential \\nexpansion citywide. \\n5. GUARANTEEING HEALTH CARE for every New Yorker, \\nto create the most comprehensive, universal coverage \\nin the nation for uninsured New Yorkers, regardless of \\nability to pay or immigration status.\\n6. ENDING THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC by treating substance \\nmisuse as the public health emergency it is, investing \\n$60 million to distribute naloxone kits and provide \\ntraining, expanding peer counseling at hospitals, and \\ndeploying engagement teams alongside first responders \\nto support people with mental health and substance \\nmisuse needs.\\n7.

At the same time, we are naturally growing, \\nas more New Yorkers are born every year than die. While this \\ngrowth reinforces our diversity and fuels the economy, it also \\ncreates greater competition for the city’s spaces and services, \\ndrives a need for more housing, and transforms neighborhoods. \\nTo ensure New York City remains a safe, welcoming, and  \\nexciting place that attracts a broad mix of people, we must  \\nmake investments to proactively accommodate this growth. \\nOtherwise the competition will only intensify, and the city \\nwill become increasingly unaffordable, particularly for our \\nmost vulnerable residents, including the elderly, low-income \\nhouseholds, and immigrants.\\nSupplying more housing is key to affordability. Despite record \\nconstruction of affordable housing since 2014, we face an acute \\nhousing shortage and rising rents in many neighborhoods. Overall \\nhousing development has not kept pace with the rising population \\nand the number of people in need. Today, more than half of New \\nYorkers are rent burdened, spending more than 30 percent of \\ntheir income on housing; more than a quarter are severely rent \\nburdened, spending more than half their income on housing.  \\nThe number of rent-burdened New Yorkers continues to grow. \\nThe impacts of the housing crisis are severe. Rent-burdened, low-\\nincome residents are forced to compromise on housing quality or \\noverextend themselves to make ends meet. Some residents have been \\nforced to leave New York, and many others who might otherwise \\nconsider moving here stay away. Businesses may struggle to attract \\npotential employees, who have difficulty finding suitable housing \\nthey can afford. Rising rents also push out small businesses, many \\nof which are family owned, as well as community organizations that \\ncan no longer find space. In an increasingly dynamic and rapidly \\nchanging environment, people and businesses often struggle to \\nmaintain their place.\\nTo meet the demands of a growing population and economy, more \\nhousing units and commercial spaces are needed to ease pressure \\non the existing housing stock and stabilize and reduce rents over \\ntime. While it may appear as though New York is constantly \\nbuilding, housing construction over the last decade is lower than \\nduring past growth spurts, and is still making up ground from \\nprevious dips. In addition, while significant development has been \\nconcentrated in Manhattan and in the western portions of Brooklyn \\nand Queens, more housing is needed in neighborhoods across the \\ncity, particularly in transit-rich neighborhoods that can support a \\nlarger population and more mixed-income rental housing, but where \\ncurrent land use rules restrict new construction, contributing to the \\nrise in rents. \\nWith a connected housing market, New York City cannot address \\nunaffordability entirely on its own. Regional forecasts suggest that, \\ncollectively, our region might grow by more than 2 million people \\nby 2040, which translates into about 40,000 new households a \\nyear. As the region’s largest city, we must find ways to support our \\nregional neighbors also working to address housing demand and \\naccommodate the region’s growth equitably.\\nA growing population and economy are critical to addressing \\naffordability, so we must leverage our strengths to close the \\naffordability gap. If New York City becomes too expensive and out \\nof reach for many residents, the benefits of living here will belong \\nto only a small segment of the population.

It enables one of the largest transit systems in the \\nworld, which helps New Yorkers maintain the lowest per-person \\ncarbon footprint of any big city in the country.

The city we enjoy exists \\nbecause density contributes to a vibrant economy, a walkable city, \\nand world-famous nightlife less dense cities simply cannot sustain.\\nNew York City is also unique because it is the only large, old U.S. \\ncity that has grown far beyond its historical peak population – \\nsince 1970, we have added more than half a million new residents. \\nThis growth has been possible because of the strong infrastructure \\nwe inherited, and our ability to use it more efficiently and extend \\nits capacity. Our capacity to grow is not infinite – we expect \\ngrowth to slow as we approach and exceed a population of 9 \\nmillion by 2050 – but as long as the city’s economy and quality of \\nlife are strong, we can expect existing residents seeking to stay, and \\nnew immigrants wishing to move here.\\nAs more people call New York City home, we will still have only \\n300 square miles of land. To accommodate our children and the \\nnext generation of newcomers, the City must find ways to use land \\nmore efficiently, and to make the key investments we need to grow \\nboth sustainably and equitably. Without finding places to locate more \\nhousing, we would be unable to provide options for all the people \\nsearching for a place to live every year, forcing increasing competition \\nfor existing housing and leading to rent hikes.

Persistent inequalities in wealth and \\nincome, as well as health and education, are inextricably linked \\nand underscore the reality that New Yorkers have not benefited \\nequally from the city’s prosperity, both in the past and today, \\nrequiring even stronger action by the City to promote equity.\\nThe gaps are starkest when viewed through the lens of race \\nand gender. In fact, while the gender pay gap in New York is \\ncomparatively lower than nationally, women — and women of \\ncolor in particular — continue to face significant inequity. In \\n2016, black women working full-time in New York City made 57 \\ncents for every dollar paid to white men; over a 40-year career, \\nthe median full-time working Hispanic woman in New York \\nCity loses $1.5 million in earnings due to the gender wage gap. \\nWhile unemployment has fallen dramatically for all groups \\nsince the last recession, it remains significantly higher for black \\nand Hispanic workers; as of 2017, the average black worker in \\nNew York City was twice as likely to be without work than a \\ncomparably educated white New Yorker.\\nThe disparities in wealth between white and nonwhite \\nhouseholds are even greater. Nationally, the median wealth \\nof white families is more than $100,000, while black median \\nwealth hovers around $10,000. This divide has deep, long-term \\nimplications. When black children become adults, they are far \\nless likely than their white counterparts to get financial help from \\ntheir parents for higher education — a disparity that has financial \\nconsequences over the course of the adult child’s life, reinforcing \\ninequities across generations.\\nInequities in New York City are reinforced by segregated neigh -\\nborhoods. Only one in four New Yorkers lives in a racially \\nintegrated neighborhood, and segregation, inequities in neigh -\\nborhood conditions, environmental injustice, and economic \\ndisparities all contribute to unequal health outcomes. Rates \\nof premature mortality and infant mortality are twice as high \\namong black New Yorkers than the citywide average. Life expec -\\ntancy in East Harlem, where residents are predominantly black \\nand Hispanic and poverty is more prevalent, is 8.6 years shorter \\nthan on the Upper East Side just a few blocks south, a predomi -\\nnantly white community with lower poverty. New York City has \\nthe highest disparity in exposure to air pollution between people \\nof color and white people, a contributing factor to heart and \\nrespiratory disease.\\nNew York City’s schools also grapple with the legacy of \\nsegregation and unequal policies. Though black and Hispanic \\nstudents make up nearly 70 percent of New York City’s public \\nschool system, in 2019, just over 10 percent of students admitted \\ninto the city’s eight specialized high schools were black or \\nHispanic. Moreover, the quality of education varies widely across \\nthe city, with students in economically disadvantaged households \\nperforming worse than their peers. Nearly three-quarters of all \\nNew York City public school students live in poverty. \\nAddressing persistent inequities in income, wealth, education, \\nand health is necessary in order to bring living standards across \\nthe city in alignment and provide equal opportunity to all \\nNew Yorkers. Without both an economic system that promotes \\nequitable growth and a concerted effort to improve services and \\naccess to care in historically neglected communities, New York \\nCity will fail to overcome the “tale of two cities” narrative that \\nhas plagued us for decades.\\nWealth and health inequities contribute to higher rates of \\npremature mortality among black New Yorkers.\\nSource: DOHMH\\n100\\n150\\n200\\n300\\n350\\n250\\n50 ASIAN\\nHISPANIC\\nBLACK\\nWHITE\\n2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 15.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 14.0 (Windows)', 'creationdate': '2019-04-30T13:48:30-04:00', 'moddate': '2020-01-03T15:55:12-05:00', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'OneNYC_2050_Strategic_Plan.pdf', 'total_pages': 332, 'page': 30, 'page_label': '31'}, page_content='31   |   O neNYC 2050\\nNYC.GOV/O neNYC\\nWE ARE A DIVERSE  \\nYET SEGREGATED CITY.  \\nDespite New York City’s plurality, the city remains \\ndivided.

Extreme heat is now the \\nnumber one cause of mortality from weather conditions, and \\nextreme storms can be ruinous. When Hurricane Sandy landed in \\n2012, it killed 44 people and caused $19 billion in damage in New \\nYork City alone. If we don’t act now, we will see major disruptions \\nto the global food supply, mass migrations as regions become \\nuninhabitable, declining biodiversity, and unpredictable impacts on \\nour economy and way of life. \\nThe cause is clear: Burning fossil fuels is the largest contributor \\nto human-caused climate change. Unfortunately, climate change \\nis a national emergency without a national policy, and efforts to \\ncurb fossil fuels and GHG emissions have been stymied by federal \\nactions as well as federal inaction. Equally troubling, a decades-long \\ncampaign of deception and denial by fossil fuel companies has tried \\nto mislead policymakers and the public, delaying the transition \\naway from fossil fuels. Climate change is an emergency, and we \\nmust mobilize now if we hope to avoid catastrophic impacts.\\n \\nLet’s look at the science: On our current trajectory, global \\ntemperature increases of 4.7 to 8.6 degrees Fahrenheit are \\nanticipated by 2100. This will directly impact all New Yorkers. \\nBy 2050, without adaptation, more New Yorkers will die each \\nsummer from intense heat. At the same time, greater dependence \\non air conditioning will place heightened demand on the city’s \\nelectrical grid, increasing the chances of larger and longer \\nblackouts in summer months and leading to infrastructure \\noutages and spoiled food and medicine stocks. It will also impact \\nour ability to meet renewable energy targets, and heighten risk \\nfor the elderly and other populations especially vulnerable to \\nheat-related illnesses.\\nHigh tides will cause flooding twice a day in some coastal \\ncommunities, and permanent inundation in others.

Most of this infrastructure \\nwas built more than a century ago, and today large segments are in \\ndesperate need of repair due to decades of disinvestment. Without \\nnew funding and upgrades, the essential systems that connect New \\nYorkers to their communities, jobs, local businesses, and schools \\n— and that are essential to meeting our climate impact goals — \\nwill continue to deteriorate. And as we look to the changing needs \\nof the 21st century, we must also address the need for new digital \\ninfrastructure, public health resources to fight infectious disease \\nthreats, and resiliency to cyber-attacks and other threats.\\nGetting around New York City is increasingly frustrating. Subways \\nare chronically underfunded, leading to declining reliability and \\nfrequent disruptions. Buses are often stuck on traffic-clogged \\nstreets. This forces New Yorkers to find alternative and often costlier \\ntransportation, such as for-hire vehicles that — together with the \\nproliferation of vehicles making online retail deliveries — worsen \\ncongestion, reduce the efficiency of above-ground transit, such as \\nbuses, and contribute to air pollution and the city’s carbon footprint.\\nMajor repair and expansion projects remain underfunded due \\nto a lack of federal support. This includes Gateway, a critical \\nreplacement rail-tunnel system connecting Manhattan with New \\nJersey that is one of the most important infrastructure projects \\nin the country. The regional economy would grind to a halt in \\nthe event of a tunnel shutdown, causing $16 billion in economic \\ndamage over an estimated four-year repair cycle and impacting \\nmillions of lives, according to the Regional Plan Association.\\nNew York City’s sewer mains are on average 85 years old, water \\nmains are 70 years old, and our electric grid dates back to the \\n1920s. One out of every 10 bridges and tunnels is structurally \\ndeficient. These deteriorating systems cause costly and dangerous \\nleaks and outages that impact residents and businesses. To restore \\npublic housing, the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) \\nestimates total capital needs of $32 billion, following decades of \\nfederal spending cuts. This disinvestment has severely hurt public \\nhousing residents, who face unreliable heat in winter as well as \\nlong wait times for repairs.\\n \\nOur modern infrastructure is not much better: Nearly one-third \\nof all New Yorkers do not have access to high-speed broadband \\ninternet at home, creating a digital divide that impacts economic \\nopportunity and quality of life. To be competitive in the 21st \\ncentury requires a population that is digitally literate and \\nprepared for jobs in the burgeoning tech sector. At the same time, \\ncyber-attacks pose an increasing risk. In 2016, hackers targeted \\ncompanies in the financial services sector more than any other. As \\nhackers become more sophisticated, and the city’s digital footprint \\nincreases with ever-more data, platforms, and systems, New York \\nCity — and our position as a global economic center — requires \\nforward-thinking investment to leverage the power of technology \\nto keep New Yorkers and our economy safe.\\nWe also face strains on our public health infrastructure. New York \\nCity is uniquely at risk of an infectious disease emergency, given \\nthe city’s density, crowded mass transit systems, and role as an \\ninternational travel hub.\\nNew York City can no longer put off massive investments to \\nmodernize our critical physical systems, leverage smart city tools, \\nmeet the evolving needs of digital connectivity, and protect the city \\nagainst disease and cyber-attacks.

While not unique to New York City, they left \\na deep legacy of inequity. Redlining deprived communities of \\ncolor access to federally backed home loans, creating segregated \\nneighborhoods upheld by public policy. Urban renewal projects \\ndisplaced thousands of people, mostly communities of color, \\nto make way for highways, housing projects, and civic centers, \\nwhile unequal siting decisions subjected poor communities to \\nincreased pollution.

What opportunities exist for them to build their lives and pursue their passions? What is the \\ncondition of their neighborhood, their city, their planet? OneNYC 2050 imagines the city we’d proudly pass on to the next generation and \\nit identifies the essential actions we must take now to realize that ambition.\\nTHIS STRATEGY IS BUILT ON 8 KEY INSIGHTS THAT REFLECT OUR CITY’S HISTORY AND THE \\nSTRENGTHS AND CHALLENGES OF THE PRESENT AND THE FUTURE:\\nTHE PATH FORWARD\\nONENYC 2050 CONSISTS OF 8 GOALS AND 30 INITIATIVES THAT COMPRISE A STRATEGY TO PREPARE NEW YORK CITY FOR THE \\nFUTURE. Each goal represents an aspiration for the city and offers initiatives for City leaders and the leaders that follow, and a model for \\nour global peers. Separate volumes outline the context for each goal and strategic actions the City will pursue in the coming years.\\n1. An empowered public is imperative for the success of \\nour democracy. Therefore, we must create A VIBRANT \\nDEMOCRACY that welcomes newcomers and engages \\nall New Yorkers in civic life. \\n2. Economic security and dignity are essential to \\novercoming long-standing inequities and creating a \\ncity where who you are doesn’t determine your success. \\nTherefore, we must build AN INCLUSIVE ECONOMY  \\nthat attracts and grows good-paying jobs and \\nguarantees fair wages and dignified work conditions. \\n3. Our lives are better and our social ties are \\nstronger when New Yorkers feel secure in their \\ncommunities. Therefore, we must support THRIVING \\nNEIGHBORHOODS  with safe, affordable housing and \\nample community resources. \\n4. Health care is a human right. Therefore, we must \\npromote HEALTHY LIVES  by guaranteeing access to \\nquality health care and a healthy environment for all, \\nregardless of neighborhood, income, race or ethnicity, \\nor gender.\\n5. A quality education is an essential step to building a \\nfulfilling life. Therefore, we must provide EQUITY AND \\nEXCELLENCE IN EDUCATION  with a focus on creating \\nstrong schools that reflect the diversity of thought, \\nbackgrounds, and experiences of the communities they serve.\\n6. Inaction on climate change will impact every corner of the \\ncity, with disproportionate harm to our most vulnerable \\nresidents. Therefore, we must secure A LIVABLE CLIMATE  \\nfor the next generation with a just transition that ends our \\nreliance on fossil fuels, fully prepares for the impacts of \\nclimate change, and achieves climate justice.\\n7. Access to affordable, reliable, safe, and sustainable \\ntransportation is central to New York’s competitiveness \\nand livability. Therefore, we must ensure EFFICIENT \\nMOBILITY  for all by restoring our subways and buses to \\nworld-class status so no New Yorker needs to rely on a car.\\n8. Resilient infrastructure is the foundation on which we \\nbuild a strong and fair city. Therefore, we will invest in \\nMODERN INFRASTRUCTURE  that serves the needs of \\nNew Yorkers and creates the systems to better deliver that \\ninfrastructure.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 15.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 14.0 (Windows)', 'creationdate': '2019-04-30T13:48:30-04:00', 'moddate': '2020-01-03T15:55:12-05:00', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'OneNYC_2050_Strategic_Plan.pdf', 'total_pages': 332, 'page': 43, 'page_label': '44'}, page_content='44   |   O neNYC 2050\\nNYC.GOV/O neNYC\\nA VIBRANT DEMOCRACY\\nWHERE EVERY NEW YORKER IS WELCOMED INTO \\nTHE CIVIC AND DEMOCRATIC LIFE OF THE CITY\\nNationally and globally, renewed forces of exclusion — \\nnationalism, anti-immigrant sentiment, and hate crimes — \\nthreaten the values and communities that make New York City \\na model of inclusion around the world, while declining trust \\nin government and civic institutions weakens our cohesion as \\na city.

A growing population \\nsupports diversity and injects new energy \\ninto our neighborhoods. A growing \\neconomy supports new jobs and provides \\ntax revenue to fund schools, transit, and \\nother public services. Growth keeps New \\nYork City competitive with peer cities \\naround the world. But at a time of rising \\nhousing costs and economic uncertainty, \\ngrowth alone is not enough. As we grow, \\nwe must ensure our neighborhoods \\nremain livable and affordable, and that all \\nNew Yorkers benefit — not just the few.\\n \\nTHE VALUES OF  \\nOneNYC 2050\\n \\nRESILIENCY\\nResiliency is both a defining feature \\nof New Yorkers and a necessity as we \\nface an increasingly uncertain future. \\nNew York City has faced and overcome \\ncatastrophic disasters, from 9/11 to \\nHurricane Sandy, and emerged stronger \\nthrough the strength and resolve of our \\npeople. Now more than ever we need to \\nready our neighborhoods, economy, and \\npublic services to withstand the impacts \\nof climate change and other 21 st century \\nthreats — from cyber threats to public \\nhealth epidemics — and emerge stronger.\\nEQUITY \\nEquity is the bedrock of our future vision \\nfor New York City. New Yorkers deserve \\nfair pay and benefits, opportunities \\nfor economic advancement, and a \\nsecure retirement. Children from all \\nneighborhoods are entitled to a quality \\neducation and a chance to pursue \\ntheir dreams. No New Yorker should \\nface higher health risks or lower life \\nexpectancy because of where they live. \\nAll communities should be safe, and all \\nresidents treated with dignity and respect \\nno matter their gender or race. And all \\nNew Yorkers should have a voice in our \\ncity’s future.\\n \\nSUSTAINABILITY\\nSustainability is how New York City \\nsecures our future. With the world’s \\nlargest subway, and dense, walkable \\nneighborhoods, New Yorkers have long \\nleft a lighter environmental footprint \\nthan other Americans — but we need \\nto go much further to preserve our \\nway of life. We need to eliminate our \\ncontributions to climate-change-causing \\nGHG emissions, and build neighborhoods \\nand infrastructure that support \\nsustainable lifestyles and consumption, \\nwhile creating economic opportunity for \\nall.\\nDIVERSITY & \\nINCLUSION\\nDiversity & Inclusion defines who we are \\nas a city. For centuries, New York City \\nhas welcomed people from all cultures, \\nreligions, and identities. New Yorkers \\ntake pride in the incredibly diverse mix of \\npeople we encounter every day. Our city is \\nstrongest when we celebrate our diversity \\nand aim to create a city where people from \\nall backgrounds can find their way and \\ncontribute to their communities and city.\\n \\nWe will build \\na strong and \\nfair city. \\nWe will be \\nOneNYC. \\nJoin us.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 15.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 14.0 (Windows)', 'creationdate': '2019-04-30T13:48:30-04:00', 'moddate': '2020-01-03T15:55:12-05:00', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'OneNYC_2050_Strategic_Plan.pdf', 'total_pages': 332, 'page': 48, 'page_label': '49'}, page_content='MAYOR DE BLASIO CELEBRATES THE RELEASE OF  ONENYC IN 2015.\\nAP/Seth Wenig\\nSTRATEGIC PLANNING  \\nIN NEW YORK CITY\\nIn 2007, New York City released PlaNYC 2030, a successful effort \\nto bring sustainability planning to New York City and confront \\nthe challenges of the time: namely economic and population\\ngrowth and their impacts on infrastructure.

But we cannot afford federal failure if we are to fully meet \\nthe challenges facing our City. A robust federal response to the challenges of our day is not \\njust important, it is essential. Historically, while Members of Congress representing New York \\nCity have led the fight to improve this situation, others in Washington refuse to deal with the \\nproblems facing our city and country, leaving us where we are today. \\nNEW YORK CITY CAN’T DO THIS ALONE\\nTHE INVESTMENTS IN FIGHTING CLIMATE \\nCHANGE THAT THE GREEN NEW DEAL \\nDEMANDS: The world faces an existential threat from climate \\nchange. Every time those in Washington who understand this \\nreality make a step forward, others find a way to force us back. \\nAs Washington pulled out of the Paris Climate Agreement, New \\nYork City served as a model for cities to keep the commitment. \\nWe need a national commitment out of Washington, like the \\nGreen New Deal demands, to invest in combating climate \\nchange, build a carbon-free electricity grid powered fully by \\nclean energy, retrofit our buildings to make them more energy \\nefficient, and transition away from reliance on fossil fuels for our \\ntransportation needs. These actions are essential to averting the \\nworst threats of climate change for New Yorkers.\\n \\nINVEST IN NEW YORK CITY’S \\nINFRASTRUCTURE: The American Society of Civil \\nEngineers gives U.S. infrastructure a D+ grade. This problem \\ndid not develop overnight, it’s due to decades of federal \\nunderinvestment in infrastructure. We need a national \\ninfrastructure strategy to become a stronger, safer, more \\naccessible City, with investments in mass transit, freight, high-\\nspeed rail, bridges, tunnels, highways, broadband and housing. \\nWe need renewed investment in water and power infrastructure \\nto secure a 100 percent renewable energy future and a just \\ntransition for communities disproportionately impacted by \\nclimate change. We need the federal government to keep its \\ncommitment to build the Gateway tunnels — helping to create \\njobs and improve New York City’s economy.\\n \\nCREATING A FAIRER SOCIETY: The economy is \\nchanging and working class people are being left behind. New \\nYorkers are working longer hours than ever but don’t see the \\nwealth that they help create. We need change in order to avert \\nthe concentration of wealth in the 1 percent, and the first step \\nis repealing the portion of the 2017 tax cuts that benefited big \\ncorporations and the rich. We can put these funds to better \\nuse – investing in infrastructure, education, and services to help \\nthose most in need. Then we need a national recommitment \\nto supporting and protecting workers, with a higher minimum \\nwage, paid sick leave, paid family leave, and other protections for \\nworkers. We must strengthen the right of all workers to organize \\nand collectively bargain, and we must create real economic \\nopportunity through support for college, job training, and access \\nto capital for starting businesses. If the federal government won’t \\nstep up then New York City will have to step in. Because we can’t \\ndo it with one hand tied behind our back, the cap on the State \\nand local tax deduction must be eliminated. \\nA COMPREHENSIVE RESILIENCY AGENDA: \\nWashington’s approach to resiliency is completely backwards, \\nonly providing resources after devastating events like Hurricane \\nSandy, instead of protecting communities from increasingly \\ndangerous natural disasters before they strike. We need a change \\n– a national commitment to resiliency and disaster preparation, \\nwith proactive infrastructure investment for coastal protections, \\nincreased funding for disaster relief, catastrophe insurance, and \\nfunds for states and localities to prepare, respond, repair, and \\nrebuild.\\n \\nCOMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM: Less \\nthan a decade ago, comprehensive immigration reform seemed \\nwithin reach, but a few in Washington have repeatedly blocked \\naction, leaving us with a system that is now being exploited \\nto spread fear and chaos in our cities. These cruel and unjust \\npolicies do not reflect New York City’s values. Immigrants also \\ncontribute to our economic success, including providing over \\n$2 billion to the GDP in our city, and we must find a way to \\nlegally grow, not halt, this impact. We need a change – real and \\ncomprehensive immigration reform. Let’s start by passing H.R. \\n6 - The American Dream and Promise Act.\\n \\nNYC.GOV/O neNYC52   |   O neNYC 2050\\nFiscal support from the \\nfederal government has \\ndeclined significantly \\nsince the 1980s.\\nREAD MORE ON PAGE 21.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 15.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 14.0 (Windows)', 'creationdate': '2019-04-30T13:48:30-04:00', 'moddate': '2020-01-03T15:55:12-05:00', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'OneNYC_2050_Strategic_Plan.pdf', 'total_pages': 332, 'page': 52, 'page_label': '53'}, page_content='NATIONAL INVESTMENT IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING: \\nThanks to years of neglect from Washington we face an affordability \\ncrisis in New York City. Instead of proposing new rules that make it \\nharder on the poorest New Yorkers, Washington should be investing in \\ncreating new affordable housing and expanding the Section 8 program. \\nInstead of the decades of disinvestment in public housing, the federal \\ngovernment should provide the resources to preserve these vital public \\nassets, and help fund capital needs at NYCHA, including the gap \\nin its physical needs assessment. Instead of ignoring protections to \\nensure fair housing, Washington should work night and day to prevent \\ndiscrimination in housing policy.\\n \\nA COMMITMENT TO EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION: \\nNew York City is leading the country on early childhood education, \\ndemonstrating that Pre-K and 3-K are vital to ensuring that all \\nchildren have the strong educational foundation they need to succeed. \\nStudies have found that students who attend two years of preschool \\nare better prepared for kindergarten and perform significantly higher \\non academic and social outcome measures compared to children \\nwho attend only one year. We cannot reach the full potential without \\nsupport from the federal government. We need a federal government \\nthat believes in the importance of investing in the next generation \\nof New Yorkers and recognizes that a strong public education is \\na cornerstone of our democracy. We need to increase Head Start \\nfunding, and we need federal resources to continue to support Pre-K \\nfor All and to expand 3K for All across the city.\\nFIXING OUR BROKEN DEMOCRACY: New York City has \\nrecently made great strides on campaign finance reform, helping \\nto restore faith in our democratic processes. But Washington must \\nreform campaign finance laws at a national level and begin the \\nprocess to reverse the Citizens United decision and eliminate the \\nElectoral College. We must make it easier to vote, so that no one is \\ndenied their right to participate because of long lines or language \\nbarriers. Washington must fully fund the 2020 Census and remove \\nthe citizenship question so that we can ensure an accurate, fair and \\norderly count and make sure New York City gets its fair share of \\nfederal resources and representation.\\nGUARANTEED HEALTH CARE AND MENTAL HEALTH \\nCARE FOR ALL: Washington made great progress in improving \\nthe lives of millions of Americans when it passed the Affordable Care \\nAct. Yet almost immediately opponents went to work trying to delay, \\nrepeal and sabotage the bill. Washington needs to strengthen, not \\nundermine, the ACA, and then must work to quickly establish a truly \\nuniversal healthcare system. In the absence of federal action, New York \\nCity is filling the gap with NYC Care, but Washington must be held \\naccountable for ensuring that all New Yorkers have access to quality \\nhealthcare. New York City has made huge progress in addressing the \\nmental health needs of New Yorkers through Thrive NYC, but we need \\nfederal support to fully confront the scourge and stigma of mental \\nhealth concerns that affect 20 percent of our population. Passing the \\nExcellence in Mental Health and Addiction Treatment Expansion Act \\nand the Comprehensive Addiction Resources Emergency Act would \\nhelp set us on the right path.\\nNYC.GOV/O neNYC53   |   O neNYC 2050'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 15.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 14.0 (Windows)', 'creationdate': '2019-04-30T13:48:30-04:00', 'moddate': '2020-01-03T15:55:12-05:00', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'OneNYC_2050_Strategic_Plan.pdf', 'total_pages': 332, 'page': 53, 'page_label': '54'}, page_content='APPENDIX\\n54   |   O neNYC 2050 \\nNYC.GOV/O neNYC'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 15.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 14.0 (Windows)', 'creationdate': '2019-04-30T13:48:30-04:00', 'moddate': '2020-01-03T15:55:12-05:00', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'OneNYC_2050_Strategic_Plan.pdf', 'total_pages': 332, 'page': 54, 'page_label': '55'}, page_content='55   |   O neNYC 2050\\nNYC.GOV/O neNYC\\nBrookings Institution, New Evidence on School Choice and Racially \\nSegregated Schools (2017)\\nBureau of Labor Statistics\\nCenter for an Urban Future, State of Work Report (2018)\\nCitizens Budget Commission, Rent Burden Report (2018)\\nFederal Reserve, Report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S. \\nHouseholds (2017)\\nFurman Center, Changing Racial and Ethnic Makeup of New York \\nCity Neighborhoods (2011)\\nIndependent Budget Office, New York City Fiscal History (2018)\\nIndependent Commission on New York City Criminal Justice and \\nIncarceration Reform, A More Just New York City (2017)\\nInternational Panel on Climate Change, Special Report on Global \\nWarming of 1.5°C (2018)\\nKlinenberg, Eric.

The City created a chief democracy \\nofficer position charged with inviting residents everywhere to \\nparticipate in democratic processes, both locally and nationally. \\nWe also launched the Civics for All initiative to educate students \\nin the foundations of civic life, expanded the City’s identification \\ncard (IDNYC), and made critical resources available to \\nimmigrants facing a changing federal legal landscape.\\nWe took bold steps to address gender-based disparities by \\ncreating the Commission on Gender Equity, which addresses \\nissues of inequity and discrimination facing girls, women, and \\ntransgender and gender non-conforming persons. We also took \\nsignificant steps to support and affirm LGBTQ communities, by \\nlaunching the NYC Unity Project, the City’s first multi-agency \\npolicy and program initiative aimed at developing affirming \\nservices for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and LGBTQ \\ncommunities across NYC. In 2017, New York City became the \\nsafest large city in the United States, with the lowest crime and \\nincarceration rates. This was achieved through engagement \\nand meaningful partnerships with communities, proving that a \\nbig city can keep its residents safe through greater community \\ninvolvement and less reliance on enforcement and incarceration.\\nNew York City has also been active on the global stage. World \\nleaders convened at the United Nations in 2015 to commit \\nto the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of eradicating \\npoverty, fighting inequality, and addressing climate change. In \\n2018, New York became the first city in the world to submit a \\nreview of progress on implementing the SDGs directly to the \\nUnited Nations.

Yet \\nvoter participation and registration and citizen engagement in \\ndemocratic processes are low, and vary by place.

Despite recent reforms, New York State’s archaic \\nelection laws have made it too difficult for many New Yorkers to \\nexercise their right to vote, and too easy for well-funded special \\ninterests to influence the outcomes of elections. In early 2019, after \\nyears of advocacy by New York City, the State Legislature passed \\nmeaningful reforms to cap corporate contributions, introduce \\nearly voting, enable online registration, and allow 16- and 17-year-\\nolds to preregister to vote, among other measures. Lawmakers also \\nbegan the process to allow same-day voter registration and no-\\nexcuse absentee voting — two policies the City will actively support \\nwhen they come up for vote in 2020.\\nBut we cannot stop there.

The commission will continue to conduct educational \\nworkshops, town halls, roundtables, and listening sessions in \\nmultiple languages to educate New Yorkers about discrimination \\nbased on race, religion, disability, gender identity, and/or sexual \\norientation.\\nThe New York City Commission on Human Rights will also \\ndeepen after-school and community-based programs to \\nempower youth with rights-based information and promote self-\\nconfidence, pride, and a sense of responsibility to one another. \\nFor example, a peer-mediation program de-escalates tension \\nbetween students, as well as empowering them to create their \\nown solutions to conflict. Other Commission programs for \\nyouth focus on empowerment of young women, dismantling \\nwhite supremacy, and human rights education, such as equitable \\nquality education and gender equality.\\nA NEW YORKER CELEBRATES LGBTQ PRIDE MONTH \\nDURING AN EVENT AT GRACIE MANSION IN 2018.\\nSource: Ed Reed/Mayoral Photography Office'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 15.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 14.0 (Windows)', 'creationdate': '2019-04-30T13:48:30-04:00', 'moddate': '2020-01-03T15:55:12-05:00', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'OneNYC_2050_Strategic_Plan.pdf', 'total_pages': 332, 'page': 85, 'page_label': '86'}, page_content='26   |   O neNYC 2050 : A VIBRANT DEMOCRACY\\nNYC.GOV/O neNYC\\nTHE MAJORITY OF THE WORLD’S POPULATION NOW LIVES IN \\nCITIES — AND THE SHARE IS GROWING, MAKING THE ROLE \\nOF CITY GOVERNMENTS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER. Cities \\nstand on the front lines of challenges such as climate change, \\ninequality, and migration, even as some national governments \\nabandon global commitments on these issues. As host city to the \\nUnited Nations and home to the largest diplomatic community in \\nthe world, New York City is uniquely positioned to ensure cities have \\na say in global policy decisions that impact the lives of New Yorkers. \\nNew York City will work with cities around the world  to strengthen \\nefforts to promote democracy and civic innovation worldwide.\\nPROVIDE GLOBAL LEADERSHIP ON CLIMATE, \\nMIGRATION, AND OTHER SHARED CHALLENGES\\nWhen the United States withdrew from the Paris Climate \\nAgreement in 2017, Mayor de Blasio took practical action by \\nsigning an executive order the very next day committing New \\nYork City to the principles of the Paris Agreement, inspiring \\ncities around the country to do the same. A few months later, we \\nbecame the first city in the world to publish a plan to meet the \\ngoals of the Paris Climate Agreement. These actions build upon \\nour longstanding leadership in the area of climate change, having \\npartnered with cities across the world in coalitions such as the \\nC40 Cities Climate Leadership Group. Additionally, New York \\nCity is at the forefront of global migration advocacy. While local \\ngovernments don’t get to decide who comes to our cities, we are \\nresponsible for the well-being and inclusion of our new arrivals, \\nfrom access to education and health care, to their relationships \\nwith law enforcement. Cities have a responsibility to make sure \\nour new neighbors have the resources to thrive. That’s why we \\nassembled a coalition of 50 cities to advocate for the inclusion of \\nlocal voices in the global migration dialogue. We will continue \\nto lift up the collective voices of cities in the implementation of \\nthe Global Compact for Migration, pressing for measures such \\nas expanded access to public services for immigrants worldwide, \\nensuring access to proof of identity, and more. Despite New York \\nCity’s progress, we remain a city with daunting challenges, just \\nlike the global community we reflect. At the same time, New York \\nCity is a hub for finance, tech, and creativity, and is therefore \\na place of opportunity and ultimately hope for the world. We \\nwill continue to engage in city diplomacy to both learn from \\nmunicipalities around the world, and share the strategies that \\nhave succeeded here.\\nLEVERAGE SDGS AS A FRAMEWORK TO \\nSHARE SUSTAINABILITY CHALLENGES AND \\nSOLUTIONS \\nNew York City is committed to doing its part to realize the SDGs. \\nThe Mayor’s Office for International Affairs (IA) established \\nthe Global Vision | Urban Action program to share New York \\nCity’s innovations in sustainability with cities and countries \\nfrom around the world. Through this program, the City invites \\nthe diplomatic corps to visit communities to see firsthand how \\nthe City is implementing SDGs at the local level, and to discuss \\nshared challenges. In turn, New York City represents local voices \\nat the UN to infuse our city’s perspective into global policy \\ndiscussions regarding the implementation of the SDGs. We will \\ncontinue to strengthen New York City’s relationships with cities \\nacross the world to help achieve all 17 SDGs by 2030.\\nEMPOWER STUDENTS TO LEAD ON THE \\nGLOBAL STAGE\\nYouth engagement is key to achieving the SDGs. We will continue \\nto empower youth through the NYC Junior Ambassadors \\nprogram. This program empowers seventh graders (ages 11–13) to \\nbecome global citizens actively engaged with the United Nations \\nand its mission of addressing the most pressing challenges in the \\nworld through curated tours of the United Nations, classroom \\nvisits from diplomats, and a community project designed to \\naddress the priorities selected by each class.\\nINITIATIVE 4 OF 30\\nPROMOTE DEMOCRACY AND CIVIC \\nINNOVATION ON THE GLOBAL STAGE'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 15.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 14.0 (Windows)', 'creationdate': '2019-04-30T13:48:30-04:00', 'moddate': '2020-01-03T15:55:12-05:00', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'OneNYC_2050_Strategic_Plan.pdf', 'total_pages': 332, 'page': 86, 'page_label': '87'}, page_content='27   |   O neNYC 2050 : A VIBRANT DEMOCRACY\\nNYC.GOV/O neNYC\\nTHE 17 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDGS) ARE THE GLOBAL BLUEPRINT ADOPTED BY ALL COUNTRIES AT THE \\nUNITED NATIONS TO ACHIEVE A BETTER AND MORE SUSTAINABLE FUTURE FOR ALL.

By \\ndemonstrating directly how OneNYC 2050 aligns with \\nthe SDGs, we strengthen our efforts to build a strong \\nand fair city. Our goal to achieve an Inclusive Economy \\nsupports the following SDGs:\\nCONTEXT\\nOUR ECONOMY IS GROWING AND DIVERSIFYING. Once overly \\nreliant on the financial sector, the city is now a tech hub and center \\nfor life sciences, professional services, and advanced manufacturing. \\nWe attract talent and investors from around the world who are drawn \\nto the city’s universities and research institutions, our vibrancy, and \\nthe enduring reality that New York City is a place where strivers and \\ndreamers can make their own success. We have also made strides \\ntoward greater economic equity, with a reduction in the gender wage \\ngap and all-time highs in high school graduation and college readiness \\nrates to prepare our young people for successful careers.\\nLearn more about the SDGs online at  \\nsustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdgs\\nWhile these are the most favorable economic conditions since \\nthe Great Recession, not every New Yorker is benefiting. Record \\njob growth has been largely driven by high-paying professional \\noccupations that require high educational attainment and low-wage \\nservice sector jobs that are not sufficient to support a family, build \\nsavings, or secure a retirement. Many New Yorkers must work multiple \\njobs, and more than 1.6 million want to work more hours but cannot \\nfind opportunities to do so. Others are in entry-level jobs with limited \\npathways for advancement, and many face exploitation and unfair \\nwork conditions. Although poverty rates are decreasing citywide, more \\nthan 40 percent of the population still lives in or near poverty today.\\nMore than 2 million New Yorkers lack the basic education and skills \\nto access middle-class jobs because they either do not have a high \\nschool diploma or high school equivalency, or have a diploma but \\nlack the required proficiency in English to secure most good-paying \\njobs. One in four transgender New Yorkers face barriers in accessing \\nemployment. Racial discrimination and historical inequities in job \\naccess and education have resulted in a persistent racial wealth gap: In \\n2016, black women working full-time in New York City made 57 cents \\nfor every dollar paid to white men. The unemployment rate remains \\nhigher for black and Hispanic workers — twice as high for black New \\nYorkers than white New Yorkers. \\nNationally, the white-to-black disparity in median net worth (the \\nvalue of a family’s combined assets minus its liabilities) is 19 to 1. \\nThis wealth disparity has a self-perpetuating effect as black children \\nborn today are less likely to be able to turn to family for help to pay \\nfor college, start a business, or weather a life emergency, thereby \\nlimiting their economic opportunity.

This will generate \\neconomic activity,  and open up opportunities in the green \\neconomy as we transform our energy system, retrofit our \\nbuildings, innovate green forms of production, and protect \\nresidents from environmental hazards.

Many seniors receive unpaid care from relatives. \\nAccording to a 2018 survey conducted by the City, there are about \\na million unpaid caregivers in New York City, mostly women over \\n50, many of whom are struggling financially. Additionally, while \\nthere is growing demand for entry-level health care positions \\nsuch as home health aides, community health workers, and \\ncertified nursing assistants, these positions are often poorly \\ncompensated and provide limited pathways to advancement and \\nhigher wages. The City will invest in programs and initiatives \\nthat elevate entry-level positions in health care and provide a \\ncareer track within the industry, such as for Career and Technical \\nEducation (CTE) high school students who transition to nursing.   \\n \\nAdvances in life sciences and health care technologies are \\nleading to the development of new business models and \\njobs.

He was an energy \\nauditor for a home improvement company, helping to make homes \\nmore energy efficient. After the company went out of business, Jamel \\nwent to work as a 311 operator. When Hurricane Sandy hit, Jamel \\nknew he wanted to be a part of the recovery effort, so he left his job \\nat 311 and entered the Edward J. Malloy Initiative for Construction \\nSkills training program. \\nThe Construction Skills program, established in 2011, gives \\nNew Yorkers from communities throughout the five boroughs \\nthe training and skills for careers in the unionized construction \\nindustry. Through union apprenticeship programs, the initiative \\nopens doors to career opportunities in the building and construction \\ntrades, and thereby helps strengthen the city’s middle class. \\nFor the first two years of his apprenticeship with the Carpenters, \\nJamel worked exclusively on homes in the Build It Back program. \\nLaunched after Hurricane Sandy, and funded by the US Department \\nof Housing and Urban Development, the Build It Back program \\nrepairs, rebuilds, and elevates homes to enhance the resiliency of our \\nwaterfront communities. Jamel says he won’t rest until every one of \\nhis neighbors is back in a strong, resilient home. \\nToday, Jamel is in the third year of his apprenticeship and working \\non the revitalization and transformation of the Moynihan Station, \\nthe $2.5 billion expansion of Penn Station in Manhattan.

When taken with the expanded \\nadult education and workforce system previously described, these \\ninitiatives will create accountability and efficiency through common \\ndefinitions and metrics in both public- and private-sector hiring.\\n• LEVERAGE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS \\nTO CREATE HIGH-QUALITY JOBS  \\nTo leverage jobs created through the City’s $100 billion Ten-Year \\nCapital Strategy, the City will, through capital construction \\ninvestments, explore ways to train low-income residents and \\nconnect them to construction careers and projects in their \\ncommunities. This funding will support workforce diversity \\nand ensure the hiring of local workers and workers from \\nunderrepresented groups, including women, people of color, and \\nLGBTQ communities. The City has used this approach through \\nBuild It Back, a program to repair, rebuild, and protect homes in \\ncommunities affected by Hurricane Sandy, and provide residents \\nimpacted by Sandy with job training and apprenticeships. \\nThe New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) also offers \\nan opportunity to integrate these approaches, as its residents \\ninclude some of the most at-risk individuals with regard to \\nemployment and income security. HireNYCHA will create \\na coordinated system for training and connecting NYCHA \\nresidents to jobs related to construction, maintenance, \\nenvironmental remediation, and pest control.  \\n \\nTo broaden the impact of projects involving City tax dollars \\nor City property, the City will also advocate for changes in \\nState law to allow for increased employment opportunities \\nresulting from such projects for disadvantaged individuals \\nand individuals from disadvantaged regions. Current State \\nlegislation makes it challenging to implement effective hiring \\npolicies that benefit the communities that often surround \\nredevelopment projects or other projects involving the \\nexpenditure of City tax dollars. To improve the effectiveness \\nand accountability, and expand the scope of current hiring \\npolicies, the City will launch a campaign to change state law, so \\nthe City can implement policies with teeth.\\n• MAKE THE CIVIL SERVICE SYSTEM MORE ACCESSIBLE  \\nTO ALL NEW YORKERS \\nNew York City will be a model employer of choice, ensuring our \\nworkforce is reflective of the diversity and inclusion of New York \\nCity communities. Not only do inclusive employment policies \\ncontribute to enhancing the skills of underrepresented groups \\nof New Yorkers — they also strengthen the City’s performance, \\nincrease the economic security of previously excluded \\nprofessionals and their families, enhance trust in government with \\na workforce that reflects the community it serves, and create a \\npipeline of young leaders to join New York City government.  \\nSome City agency careers require only a high school diploma \\nor some college credits, which helps residents enter and \\nremain in the City workforce. The City is  exploring ways it \\ncan streamline processes to make these jobs more available to \\nall residents. Approaches could include identifying potential \\nentry-level opportunities and apprenticeships within trade, craft, \\nmaintenance, and inspection positions across City agencies and \\nin the future, developing and piloting apprenticeship programs \\nwithin identified job categories.  \\nThe City will also continue targeted recruitment in communities \\nunderrepresented in City government, such as LGBTQ, veterans, \\nyouth, and people with disabilities. The City will continue to make \\nthe job application and examination process more accessible for \\nresidents of all backgrounds with modern application systems and \\nexpanded computer-based testing centers in all five boroughs. This \\nwill allow even more New Yorkers to take exams and access civil \\nservice information in their communities. \\n \\nThe City continuously explores ways to increase access to civil \\nservice and employment opportunities for all New Yorkers. \\nOur newly launched Civil Service Pathways Fellowship (CSPF) \\nprogram speaks to that effort. CSPF places highly qualified recent \\nCUNY graduates into entry-level, career-track positions within \\nCity government, and provides them with specialized training \\nwhile preparing them for a civil service exam after the first year \\nof work. In addition, the City will now seek legislative approval \\nto expand fee waivers for veterans seeking to take civil service \\nexams, thereby removing financial barriers for veterans pursuing \\na civil service career. \\n \\n“Words can’t even describe how I’m feeling.

Small \\nbusinesses are essential to both the local economy and the character \\nof our neighborhoods, providing opportunities for individuals to \\nstrengthen their own economic security and employ members of \\ntheir communities. The City supports businesses as they start, \\noperate, and grow by providing free services at scale and investing in \\ninnovative projects that create long-term change for entrepreneurs \\nacross the City.  \\n• STREAMLINE REGULATORY INTERACTIONS\\nThe City will create a unique business identifier citywide to track \\nbusiness records across agencies, improving operational efficiency \\nand saving time for small businesses.

WE Fund: Credit helps women \\nentrepreneurs access lines of credit. WE Venture is a $10 million \\nNYC EDC initiative to encourage Venture Capital Partners to \\ninvest in companies founded by women.\\n• SUPPORT NEIGHBORHOOD BUSINESS \\nA complex mix of factors is influencing the retail sector today, \\nfrom e-commerce to changing consumer habits and preferences. \\nTo help small businesses navigate these challenges, SBS \\nwill double down on its support of longstanding businesses \\nconfronting changing market conditions.  Last year the City \\nlaunched its Commercial Lease Assistance Program, which \\nprovides a range of services including guidance on new leases \\nand lease renewals and assistance with breach of contracts \\nand landlord harassment.  Through the Love Your Local Small \\nBusiness Grant program, SBS awarded in-depth assessments with \\nbusiness consultants and grant funding to small businesses in \\nneighborhoods with rising commercial rents. SBS will learn from \\nthese engagements and test creative business interventions with \\nthe aim of developing scalable solutions to support longstanding \\nbusinesses.  \\nINVEST IN THE SPACE FOR EQUITABLE \\nGROWTH\\nTo continue growing our economy in an equitable way, New York \\nCity must have adequate commercial and industrial space, and \\npromote job opportunities in all five boroughs. Policy changes \\nand City investments over the past few years have helped stabilize \\nthe decline in industrial and manufacturing jobs. The City has \\nalso seen job growth — and not only in Manhattan. \\n• SUPPORT THE CREATION OF MODERN WORKSPACE THAT \\nBRINGS GOOD JOBS CLOSER TO NEW YORKERS\\nIn today’s rapidly changing economy, small and growing \\nbusinesses rely on the ability to find flexible, quality workspace \\nthat is easily accessible to their workers and clients. This means \\na growing need for a variety of offices and other workspace \\nin transit-accessible locations outside the Manhattan core, \\nwhere they can provide opportunities for a local workforce as \\nwell as tap into reverse-commute transit capacity. Through \\nCity-initiated neighborhood plans, such as in Gowanus, as well \\nas in private applications, zoning can be updated to support \\nthe creation of more workspace and jobs for a wide range of \\nbusinesses. In addition to allowing more flexibility for existing \\nindustrial businesses to expand in place, opportunities exist to \\nrelieve unnecessary parking requirements in transit-accessible \\nareas, allow new, mid-density, loft-style buildings, and remove \\noutdated distinctions among business types to accommodate \\nthe increasing cross-pollination of activities in today’s \\neconomy.\\n• RELOCATE CITY AGENCIES AND OFFICES TO SPUR \\nEQUITABLE GROWTH ACROSS THE CITY \\nThe City’s office anchor strategy incentivizes new office \\ndevelopment in areas away from central business districts by \\nstrategically leasing space for City agencies and offices. The \\nHuman Resources Administration (HRA) will be the first \\nagency moved in this new program, anchoring at least one \\ndevelopment in Brooklyn with 275,000 square feet of office \\nspace. The balance of the space in the building will be available \\nfor lease to businesses and nonprofits. In addition, HRA’s move \\nwill free up office space that it currently occupies in higher-\\ndemand areas of the city, thereby delivering additional space \\nfor private use. \\n• CREATE AFFORDABLE WORKSPACES FOR ARTISTS  \\nArtists in New York City face challenges finding affordable \\nworkspaces.

To \\nstrengthen local businesses and economies, the City will work \\nwith citywide stakeholders to support 25 percent of New York \\nCity-based anchor institutions making commitments and taking \\nmeasurable actions toward generating community wealth and \\nresilience by 2025.\\nINCREASE EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP TO \\nPRODUCE VALUE FOR WORKING NEW YORKERS\\nTo create a more fair, democratic, and resilient city, the City will \\ninvest in a comprehensive strategy to grow employee-owned \\nbusinesses. Workers drive innovation and deserve a fair-share \\nof our City’s economic prosperity. Ownership of businesses \\nincreases job stability, income, and wealth for workers. Employee-\\nownership increases productivity and helps improve the bottom-\\nline for businesses. Such businesses are on average 2.4 percent \\nmore productive than firms without those practices.  The vision \\nof employee-ownership and economic democracy has been \\nseeded across the country. New York City has the opportunity to \\nrealize this at scale and ensure inclusive and lasting growth for \\nthe future. The City will build a business development ecosystem \\nand make investments so that our businesses and workers are \\nequipped to share in the profits and decision-making that grow \\nour economy.\\nINITIATIVE 7 OF 30\\nEXPAND THE VOICE, OWNERSHIP, AND \\nDECISION-MAKING POWER OF WORKERS \\nAND COMMUNITIES'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 15.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 14.0 (Windows)', 'creationdate': '2019-04-30T13:48:30-04:00', 'moddate': '2020-01-03T15:55:12-05:00', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'OneNYC_2050_Strategic_Plan.pdf', 'total_pages': 332, 'page': 115, 'page_label': '116'}, page_content='24   |   O neNYC 2050 : AN INCLUSIVE ECONOMY\\nNYC.GOV/O neNYC\\nLEVERAGE CITY-OWNED ASSETS TO  \\nPROTECT COMMUNITY WEALTH AND \\nGENERATE HOUSING ASSETS \\nTransforming City-owned assets into affordable housing co-\\noperatives and protecting existing housing assets for low-, middle-, \\nand moderate-income (LMI) communities will expand wealth-\\ngenerating opportunities to individuals shut out from the housing \\nmarket.

With an annual operating \\nbudget of more than $90 billion, City programs are essential to \\nlifting up communities and supporting the social safety net. \\nImproving government operations streamlines delivery of critical \\nservices and creates savings.\\nOver the past five years, the City has dramatically increased \\nbudget reserves and maintained a focus on savings, including \\nbuilding long-term savings into the financial plan. Due in part \\nto these efforts, in March 2019, the City received its highest-ever \\ncredit rating for issuance of general obligation bonds. Citing a \\ndiversified economy, talented labor pool, and strong financial \\nmanagement, Moody’s acknowledged the City has a stable \\nfinancial outlook, allowing greater flexibility in the event of an \\neconomic downturn.\\nHowever, we must be prepared to maintain financial stability in \\nthe face of shifting national and global economic forces. Reduced \\nsupport at the State and federal levels, increased trade volatility, \\nand the continued risk of climate change present clear challenges \\nto our financial health. The City is committed to addressing these \\nchallenges and building financial resiliency. \\nINCREASE SAVINGS THROUGH IMPROVED \\nGOVERNMENT OPERATIONS \\nThe modernization of City operations benefits everyone, \\nincluding residents who rely on City services, and vendors that do \\nbusiness with us. It also allows us to better practice such shared \\nvalues as energy efficiency, technological modernization, and \\ncost prudence. The City will continue to develop its cost-saving \\ninitiatives to improve internal operations and explore additional \\nopportunities to help build savings. The following initiatives \\nhighlight a subset of the City’s recent savings efforts — which \\ninclude both short-term cost savings and long-term operational \\nimprovements:\\n• REDUCE THE SIZE OF THE CITY FLEET AND IMPROVE ITS \\nEFFICIENCY \\nThe City is transforming its vehicular fleet to reduce emissions \\nand improve safety. The number of electric vehicles (EV) has \\nincreased from 211 in FY14 to more than 1,750 today, and will \\ntotal more than 2,000 by summer. As part of Vision Zero, NYC \\nFleet has implemented a Safe Fleet Transition Plan to procure \\nsafer, more efficient vehicles for all agencies to reduce both \\ncrashes and their subsequent claims costs. \\n \\nDespite a growing workforce, the City has maintained the \\nsame garage footprint and increased fuel efficiency at a time \\nwhen strategic priorities, such as more vehicles for community \\npolicing, have mandated an increase in overall vehicle count. \\nFleet initiatives as part of the Citywide Savings Program led to \\n$20 million in savings between 2018 and 2019.  \\n \\nThe 2019 Fleet Executive Order mandates increased \\nsustainability and efficiency, requiring all agencies to achieve \\nheightened environmental and efficiency targets, with the help \\nof advanced sensor technology (telematics) across all vehicles. \\nThese measures will, each year, reduce vehicle miles traveled \\nby 10 million, decrease emissions from municipal vehicles \\nby more than 6,300 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent \\n(2.5 percent of municipal fleet emissions), and save more than \\n500,000 gallons of fuel. These actions will save millions of \\ndollars across City agencies by reducing on-road vehicle units, \\nimproving commuting patterns, and downsizing away from \\nSUVs. The City will also accelerate its transition to EV and \\nhybrid vehicles — including hybrid policing units — reducing \\nour total fuel consumption to below 2014 levels.\\n• IMPLEMENT STRATEGIC REAL ESTATE PLANNING  \\nACROSS THE CITY’S PORTFOLIO \\nIn 2018, the City created an initiative led by the Department of \\nCitywide Administrative Services (DCAS) to evaluate its real \\nestate portfolio with the goal of reducing the cost of leased \\nspaces and maximizing the use of owned spaces. The initiative \\nwill assess opportunities to maximize space utilization, and \\nestablish key performance indicators to improve square-footage \\nallocation and vacancy rates, and decrease leased space by \\nborough over the next decade. These initiatives aim to create \\nchanges to building layouts that will not only reduce our'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 15.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 14.0 (Windows)', 'creationdate': '2019-04-30T13:48:30-04:00', 'moddate': '2020-01-03T15:55:12-05:00', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'OneNYC_2050_Strategic_Plan.pdf', 'total_pages': 332, 'page': 117, 'page_label': '118'}, page_content='26   |   O neNYC 2050 : AN INCLUSIVE ECONOMY NYC.GOV/O neNYC\\noverall space footprint, but also modernize workspaces for a \\nmore efficient, healthier, and productive office layout. Over \\ntime, this team will strategically evaluate purchase and lease \\ndecisions across the City’s portfolio of buildings to ensure the \\nCity is positioned to deliver services in the right location, at \\nthe right time. These initiatives could enable further savings \\nopportunities, including a densified office portfolio and \\nincreased employee satisfaction and retention. In FY19 alone, \\nthe City has generated $3 million in cost avoidance by declining \\nrequests for new space. \\n• REDUCE THE COST OF PROCURED GOODS AND SERVICES  \\nThe City is using state-of-the-art vendor management \\ntechnology to improve the procurement process for both \\nagencies and contractors. As part of this ongoing improvement, \\nthe City’s more than $20 billion in annual procured goods \\nand services will be digitized and streamlined through the \\nProcurement and Sourcing Solutions Portal (PASSPort). \\nPASSPort will help make bids more competitive by decreasing \\nthe complexity required for vendors to navigate the City’s \\ncontracting process. In parallel, these efforts are expected to \\nprovide new opportunities for small businesses, including\\nM/WBEs, to better access City resources to grow their \\nenterprises.  \\n \\nThe City is developing a state-of-the-art procurement platform \\nto reduce the City’s administrative costs in procuring goods \\nand services across 41 mayoral agencies, collect data to \\nstrategically source goods and services based on quality and \\npricing, and consolidate and centralize the City’s purchasing \\nthrough master contracts that provide discount pricing for \\nbulk purchasing.\\nIn procurement’s current state, thousands of agency and \\nvendor personnel interact through paper and email to establish \\nand manage contracts, monitor quality and ensure accurate \\npayment across a $20 billion annual purchasing portfolio.  The \\nCity is designing the Procurement and Sourcing Solutions \\nPortal (PASSPort) to standardize, digitize, centralize, and \\nstreamline procurement practices across the City with the goal \\nof reducing the time and administrative effort that it takes \\nfor the City to purchase goods and services.  These efforts \\nalso benefit vendors and nonprofit providers by decreasing \\nthe complexity required for these stakeholders to navigate \\nthe City’s contracting process. These efforts are expected to \\nprovide new opportunities for small businesses, including \\nM/WBEs, with increased access to City resources and \\nopportunities to grow their businesses.\\n• LIMIT AVOIDABLE LABOR COSTS FOR MUNICIPAL WORKERS  \\nThe City will reduce labor costs within our own workforce \\nwithout impeding strategic priorities. The City has already \\nsought ways to cap overtime costs for both skilled trades \\nworkers and civilian employees. Through tightened controls \\nand approval processes, these initiatives reinforce the \\nexpectation that agencies must minimize the use of overtime. \\nAt the same time, the City is smoothing the path to retirement \\nfor City workers while opening up advancement opportunities \\nfor lower-tenure employees and addressing the challenge of \\npart-time work that can be difficult to fill — at a lower cost to \\nthe taxpayer. The Silver Stars program, for example, allows \\nemployees eligible for retirement to shift from full- to part-\\ntime status at the discretion of their agency while officially \\nfiling for retirement. City employees benefit by earning their \\npension while collecting partial wages. At the same time, \\nit enables the transition of institutional knowledge while \\nexpanding opportunities for younger-tenure employees to \\napprentice or up-skill in a soon-to-be-vacant post.\\n• CONTINUE TO GENERATE SAVINGS FROM CITY HEALTH PLANS \\nFor the past two decades, health care costs have increased \\ndramatically for employers, including the City. The City has \\npartnered directly with unions, reaching agreements with the \\nMunicipal Labor Committee (MLC) that mitigate rising health \\ncare costs for City employees, both active and retired. Total \\nsavings from the two agreements through Fiscal Year 2022 is \\n$10.3 billion, with annual recurring savings of $1.9 billion in \\nFiscal Year 2021 and beyond. These savings initiatives not only \\nreduce the per capita cost of care, but also improve the health \\nof beneficiaries and the patient experience.\\nWe are also addressing the long-term health and resiliency \\nof NYC employees through worksite programs offered by \\nWorkWell NYC that are designed to support employees with \\nhealthy eating, physical fitness, disease prevention and mental \\nwell-being.\\n“The city should be a viable place to start a new \\nlife and raise a family for middle- and working-\\nclass New Yorkers.”\\n– Resident of Mapleton, Brooklyn'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 15.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 14.0 (Windows)', 'creationdate': '2019-04-30T13:48:30-04:00', 'moddate': '2020-01-03T15:55:12-05:00', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'OneNYC_2050_Strategic_Plan.pdf', 'total_pages': 332, 'page': 118, 'page_label': '119'}, page_content='27   |   O neNYC 2050 : AN INCLUSIVE ECONOMY NYC.GOV/O neNYC'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 15.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 14.0 (Windows)', 'creationdate': '2019-04-30T13:48:30-04:00', 'moddate': '2020-01-03T15:55:12-05:00', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'OneNYC_2050_Strategic_Plan.pdf', 'total_pages': 332, 'page': 119, 'page_label': '120'}, page_content='28   |   O neNYC 2050 : AN INCLUSIVE ECONOMY\\nNYC.GOV/O neNYC\\nINITIATIVE #5: GROW THE ECONOMY WITH GOOD-PAYING JOBS AND PREPARE NEW YORKERS TO FILL THEM  \\nSTEPS TO GET THERE AGENCY OWNER FUNDING STATUS\\nDiversify the City’s economy and broaden access to good-paying jobs EDC, WKDEV Funded\\nStrengthen and expand the capacity of adult education in a connected \\nworkforce system WKDEV, SBS, CUNY, DOE, DYCD Partially Funded\\nIntegrate human capital investment into all City initiatives WKDEV, SBS Funded\\nSupport the growth and retention of small businesses SBS , EDC Funded\\nInvest in the space for equitable growth EDC Funded\\nINDICATORS LATEST DATA TARGET\\nLabor force participation rate 60.8% (2019) Increase\\nIndividuals connected to employment through the City’s workforce \\ndevelopment programs \\n66,390 (2018) Increase\\nTotal employment 4.5M (2018) Increase\\nIncome disparity by race (median household earnings of white \\nhouseholds divided by median household earnings of black, Hispanic, \\nAsian, and other race households)\\n2.0 (2017) Decrease\\nINITIATIVE #6: PROVIDE ECONOMIC SECURITY FOR ALL THROUGH FAIR WAGES, AND EXPANDED BENEFITS\\nSTEPS TO GET THERE AGENCY OWNER FUNDING STATUS\\nAggressively enforce fair wages and working conditions Opportunity, DCWP TBD\\nGuarantee access to lifeline benefits Opportunity, HR A Partially Funded\\nAddress high living costs and debt loads Opportunity, DCA, Mayor’s Office to \\nProtect Tenants\\nFunded\\nINDICATORS LATEST DATA TARGET\\nPercentage of New Yorkers living in or near poverty 43.6% (2016) Decrease\\nNew Yorkers lifted out of poverty or near poverty (since 2014) 236,500 (2017) 800,000 by 2025\\nFood insecurity rate 14.4% Decrease\\nTHE PATH FORWARD\\nTO ACHIEVE OUR GOALS, WE MUST HAVE A PLAN AND HOLD OURSELVES ACCOUNTABLE.

The housing \\ncrisis is largely the result of rents rising faster than wages and \\na housing stock that has not kept up with our needs, which has \\ncontributed to the widening gap between housing demand and \\nadequate supply. The ongoing housing crisis has contributed to a \\nsignificant rise in homelessness, with approximately 60,000 New \\nYorkers sleeping in shelters today. \\nRecent housing production has been high  \\ncompared with the 1980s and 1990s, but is still far \\nlower than it was earlier in the city’s history.

It \\nhas financed over 122,000 affordable housing units, which alone \\ncould house the population of Pittsburgh. In 2017, we committed \\nto accelerating and expanding the pace of Housing New York   to \\ncreate or preserve 300,000 affordable apartments by 2026 — \\n100,000 more than initially planned. Nearly 40 percent of these \\nunits are reserved for very low-income or extremely low-income \\nhouseholds, also surpassing initial projections. \\nThe City also passed the most aggressive Mandatory Inclusionary \\nHousing policy in the nation, requiring developers whose properties \\nare rezoned to allow additional capacity to dedicate a portion of \\nthe new housing to be permanently affordable. To date, rezoning \\nactions sufficient to create approximately 5,800 permanently \\naffordable units have been approved through individual project \\napprovals, with thousands more units made possible through \\nrezonings as part of neighborhood plans. Zoning for quality and \\naffordability removed many regulatory barriers (e.g., parking \\nrequirements, impractical height limits) that significantly \\nconstrained the creation of affordable and senior housing projects. \\nWHAT WE HEARD FROM  \\nNEW YORKERS\\nHOUSING WAS THE MOST FREQUENTLY CITED \\nCHALLENGE  facing New York City in our citywide survey, \\nwith 63 percent of more than 14,000 respondents selecting \\nthe issue, while 29 percent selected public safety.

These neighborhoods also suffered \\nfrom neglected parks, poor access to healthy food, and struggling \\ncommercial corridors.\\nWHAT WE WILL DO  \\nONENYC 2050 OFFERS BIG SOLUTIONS TO BIG CHALLENGES, \\nINCLUDING PLANS TO CREATE AND PRESERVE 300,000 UNITS \\nOF AFFORDABLE HOUSING, AND GENERATE 100,000 GOOD-\\nPAYING JOBS. This requires supporting continued mixed-income \\nhousing creation in transit-accessible areas and supporting \\ntransit-oriented growth across the region. The City will pursue \\nthese ambitious goals through plans that are formulated at \\nthe neighborhood scale, with an emphasis on affordability and \\nlivability. \\nOneNYC 2050 details plans to create a network of quality open \\nspaces that connect our playgrounds, parks, plazas, and beaches to \\nhomes and workplaces with bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure. \\nWe will activate hidden open spaces, including the waterfront, \\nvacant sliver lots, and areas under elevated trains and highways. \\nWe will target cultural investments to low-income neighborhoods \\nthat have rich cultural assets but little institutional support. All \\nneighborhoods will have access to healthy food as the network of \\ngreen markets is expanded, making it more affordable for low-\\nincome families to shop at them. Equally importantly, the City will \\nprovide tools that enable communities to meaningfully participate \\nin the planning of their neighborhoods. \\nA reformed 421a program requires affordable housing in rental \\nproperties using the exemption, and eliminates tax breaks for \\nluxury condos. Taken together, the City is in a position to reach a \\nsustained goal of 25,000 affordable units preserved or constructed \\nper year — a rate it has never before achieved.\\nTo address homelessness, the City has undertaken a major \\ncommitment to housing services for the most vulnerable New \\nYorkers. In 2016, we restructured the way homeless services are \\ndelivered, creating a streamlined management structure under \\nthe Department of Social Services. Today, low-income New \\nYorkers facing an immediate housing crisis have a single point of \\ncontact, Homebase, wherein all their housing needs can be met, \\nincluding support services and short-term and ongoing financial \\nassistance. Homebase programs craft individualized service plans \\nwith core services to help individuals remain in stable housing. \\nSince 2014, the Homebase program has been expanded from 14 to \\n26 locations, and now provides coordinated preventive, aftercare, \\nand community support services, including benefits advocacy, \\nbudgeting, employment, short-term financial assistance, and \\nassistance with housing relocation. For the last few years, the \\nnumber of people in City shelters has remained flat for the first \\ntime in a decade — and evictions dropped by 37 percent citywide \\nbetween 2013 and 2018, enabling more than 100,000 New Yorkers \\nto stay in their homes. Other efforts to protect tenants include \\nlaunching the Tenant Anti-Harassment Unit and introducing \\nuniversal access to legal representation for low-income tenants \\nfacing evictions in Housing Court.\\nThe City also launched groundbreaking efforts to improve \\nneighborhood parks through the Community Parks Initiative \\nand Parks Without Borders, working with communities to invest \\nin public spaces in dense and growing neighborhoods that have \\nnot seen major investment in decades. In addition to improving \\nparks within the boroughs, the City released plans to complete the \\nManhattan greenway, a 33-mile loop that will run continuously \\naround the edge of the island of Manhattan. The Manhattan \\ngreenway is nearly complete, and may be extended to the city’s \\nother boroughs. \\nMore funding enabled libraries citywide to offer six-day service and \\nextend branch hours, while capital investments increased access \\nto millions of books, resources, and programs. Customized plans \\nfor the commercial revitalization of thoroughfares, through the \\nNeighborhood 360 program, strengthen the small businesses and \\nstreets that anchor our neighborhoods. In 2017, the City released \\nCreateNYC, New York City’s first-ever comprehensive cultural plan, \\nwhich outlines a path to diversify and increase access to arts and \\nculture programming throughout the city, thereby reinforcing a \\ncornerstone of our city’s identity.

It is crucial that current and future tenants in New \\nYork City have access to stable and secure housing. \\n \\n• PROTECT TENANTS FROM DISPLACEMENT \\nThe City is continuing efforts to protect tenants from \\nharassment, unsafe living conditions, and displacement by \\nunscrupulous landlords. In 2019, the City launched a new \\nMayor’s Office to Protect Tenants that will lead the City’s anti-\\nharassment and outreach initiatives across multiple agencies, \\nutilize data to focus efforts, and coordinate with advocates.     \\nWe are also expanding efforts to protect tenants through the \\nTenant Anti-Harassment Unit housed at the Department of \\nHousing Preservation and Development (HPD), and the launch \\nof data-driven tools such as the Speculation Watch List and \\nCertification of No Harassment program. Another program, \\nPartners in Preservation, is rolling out in East Harlem, Inwood, \\nand Jerome Avenue in the Bronx to work with community-based \\norganizations to jointly coordinate anti-displacement initiatives \\n— such as code enforcement, tenant organizing and education, \\nlegal representation, affirmative litigation, and other strategies. \\n• PROVIDE TENANT LEGAL AID TO ALL NEW YORKERS BY 2022 \\nFor decades, tenants who found themselves facing eviction \\noften lacked legal representation and were therefore at a severe \\ndisadvantage. New York City is the first city in the nation to \\ncommit to providing every tenant facing eviction in housing \\ncourt or NYCHA termination of tenancy proceedings with free \\nlegal services — a plan which at full implementation is expected \\nto provide services to 400,000 individuals annually. The City \\nis funding and implementing its Universal Access to Counsel \\ninitiative in phases and, since 2014, City-funded legal services \\nfor tenants have provided assistance to a quarter-million New \\nYorkers facing the threat of eviction and displacement. \\n• SEEK REFORM TO STATE RENT REGULATION LEGISLATION \\nThe rent-stabilized housing stock is an irreplaceable source \\nof low-cost housing that is affordable to low- and moderate-\\nincome New Yorkers. Median household income for rent-\\nstabilized units is 33 percent lower than that of private, renter-\\noccupied units. Under the current system, the City is at risk of \\nlosing lower-cost rent-regulated units, which are critical to our \\nability to meet the housing needs of low- and moderate-income \\nNew Yorkers. The City’s guiding principles for reforming the \\nrent regulation system are:\\n1. Retaining rent stabilized stock\\n2. Preserving affordability and stabilizing rent levels\\n3. Ensuring current tenants are secure in their homes and \\nneighborhoods\\n4. Protecting benefits of rent stabilization for future tenants\\n5. Maintaining the quality of the stock\\n• IMPLEMENT NYCHA 2.0 TO SUPPORT THE SUCCESS OF THE \\nLARGEST PUBLIC HOUSING AUTHORITY \\nIn late 2018, the City announced NYCHA 2.0, a comprehensive \\nplan to preserve public housing. This plan will ensure residents \\nhave the safe, decent, and affordable homes they deserve by \\nmaking critical fixes, improving operations, and creating new \\nfunding sources. The Fix to Preserve program addresses health \\nand safety issues including heating, mold, pests, and lead. It will \\nalso improve services and maintenance through organizational \\nchanges and improved service-delivery models. To create new \\nfunding sources, PACT to Preserve will use Department of \\nHousing and Urban Development (HUD) Section 8 funding, \\nincluding Rental Assistance Demonstration, to fund renovations \\nand convert 62,000 apartments to permanently affordable \\nhousing. Build to Preserve will address roughly $2 billion in capital \\nrepairs through new development on NYCHA land. Transfer to \\nPreserve will deliver approximately $1 billion in capital repairs \\nthrough the sale of unused development rights, also known as air rights. \\n• HELP LOW-INCOME HOMEOWNERS STAY IN THEIR HOMES \\nMany low-income homeowners are not able to afford home \\nrepairs, especially families struggling to make mortgage \\npayments. These repairs are essential to maintaining the health \\nand safety of a home. The City recently launched HomeFix to \\nhelp low- and moderate-income homeowners in one-, two-, \\nthree-, or four-family properties fund home repairs, while also \\nleveraging the services of community and nonprofit partners. \\nIt is estimated that HomeFix will serve approximately 100 \\nhouseholds per year over the next eight years. The City will \\nexplore expansion based on initial program results.  \\nCREATE OR PRESERVE 300,000 AFFORDABLE \\nUNITS BY 2026 AND INCREASE OVERALL \\nHOUSING SUPPLY\\n \\nTo address the affordability crisis head on, in 2017 the City \\ncommitted to accelerating and expanding the pace of Housing New \\nYork to achieve 300,000 affordable apartments by 2026. Through \\na range of strategies, including land use actions, new financing \\ntools, partnerships with nonprofit organizations, and innovative \\nnew approaches, we will find more efficient ways to design and \\nbuild affordable units and deliver them on time, and also make \\nmore land available for developing affordable and mixed-income \\nhousing. \\n• PARTNER WITH COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS TO PRESERVE \\nAFFORDABILITY \\nThe City launched Neighborhood Pillars, a $275 million \\npublic-private fund to help nonprofit organizations acquire, \\nand preserve affordability in, existing unregulated and \\nrent-stabilized buildings.

For \\nexample, sites at Sunnyside Yard and Willets Point in Queens \\nand the New Stapleton Waterfront in Staten Island can support a \\ndevelopment program with a substantial housing component. \\n• CONTINUE THE CLEANUP AND REDEVELOPMENT OF \\nBROWNFIELD SITES \\nThe City has over 8,500 properties designated by the City as \\nsubject to mandatory environmental study and management. \\nThe City assists community based-organizations to plan and \\nredevelop vacant or underutilized land in their neighborhoods, \\nthrough technical assistance and grants.  Since 2014, 756 \\nlots covering 187 acres were cleaned up through brownfield \\nprograms, supporting the creation of more than 5,200 affordable \\nand supportive housing units. The City is committed to \\ncontinuing this work by cleaning up 850 additional lots by 2021.\\nMore than half of New Yorkers are rent burdened, spending more than 30 percent of their income on hous-\\ning, and more than a quarter are severely rent burdened, spending more than half their income on housing. \\nRENT BURDENED HOUSEHOLDS BY INCOME GROUP (BASED ON A FAMILY OF FOUR), 2017\\nSource: Census Bureau Housing and Vacancy Survey: 2017 Microdata; Income brackets from HUD\\n50,000\\n100,000\\n150,000\\n200,000\\n250,000\\nNUMBER OF RENTER-\\nOCCUPIED HOUSEHOLDS\\n% OF HUD INCOME LIMIT (FISCAL YEAR 2017)\\n0-10\\n100-11030-40 130-14070-80 160-17010-20 110-12040-50 140-15080-90 170-180 190-20020-30 120-13060-70 150-16090-100 180-19050-60\\nSEVERELY RENT BURDENED\\nMODERATELY RENT BURDENED\\nPUBLIC HOUSING/RENTAL ASSISTANCE\\nNOT BURDENED, NO RENTAL ASSISTANCE\\nSUNNYSIDE YARD\\nSUNNYSIDE YARD IS A 180-ACRE ACTIVE PUBLIC \\nRAILYARD IN WESTERN QUEENS.

Seniors and people with disabilities often have \\nspecific housing requirements that can be a challenge to meet \\nwith limited budgets in a tight housing market. We are commit -\\nted to expanding initiatives to aid and support residents who face \\ncritical housing needs. \\n \\n• EXPAND RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS TO PREVENT \\nHOMELESSNESS  \\nSince 2014, the City has launched several new rental assistance \\nprograms. In 2018, the City streamlined all City-funded rental \\nassistance programs into a single subsidy so at-risk New Yorkers \\ncould easily access them. As of March 2018, these programs have \\nhelped more than 109,000 New Yorkers move out of shelters or \\navoid homelessness. We will also reinstate rehousing programs to \\nprevent homelessness and provide permanent housing options for \\nalready homeless families and adults. \\n• REIMAGINE THE SHELTER STRATEGY  \\nThe City’s primary goal is to keep families and individuals \\nfrom losing their homes and ending up on the street or in \\nshelter. When staying in a shelter is unavoidable, it is the city’s \\ngoals to provide shelter in a way that enables New Yorkers \\nwho are homeless to stabilize their lives and move back into \\ntheir communities as soon as possible. Reimagining the \\nshelter system included closing cluster apartments, closing \\ncommercial hotels and replacing them with approximately 90 \\nnew shelters to shrink the city-wide shelter footprint, improve \\nthe quality of services and keep people in their neighborhoods. \\n• SERVE 30,000 SENIOR HOUSEHOLDS BY 2026  \\nWe are doubling our efforts in senior housing to serve 30,000 \\nhouseholds over the extended 12-year plan. To meet this \\nadditional commitment, the City has launched Seniors First, a \\nthree-pronged strategy to enable seniors to age in place, make \\nmore housing accessible to people with disabilities, build senior \\nhousing on underused public land, and target federal HUD 202 \\ndevelopments for preservation efforts. As part of that, HPD’s \\nSenior Affordable Rental Apartments (SARA) Program provides \\ngap financing in the form of low-interest loans to support the \\nconstruction and renovation of affordable housing for low-\\nincome New Yorkers aged 62 and up. To date, we have financed \\nnearly 7,400 senior homes. \\n• CREATE 75,000 AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS FOR VERY  \\nLOW-INCOME HOUSEHOLDS BY 2026 \\nAs part of its plan to provide 300,000 units of affordable housing \\nto New Yorkers by 2026, the City is committed to serving the \\npoorest New Yorkers. These include 31,500 homes for extremely \\nlow income households making $28,170 or less per year for a \\nfamily of three, and 43,500 homes for low income households \\nmaking less than $46,950 per year for a family of three. \\nSince 2013, the number of evictions in New York \\nCity has fallen by 37 percent.

It is inspired by HUD’s 2015 Affirmatively \\nFurthering Fair Housing Rule, which pushed cities to analyze \\nfair housing issues more thoughtfully, and develop innovative \\ngoals and strategies to empower more residents to live in thriving \\nneighborhoods. Through Where We Live NYC, New York City \\nis working with community leaders, residents, and government \\npartners to create the next chapter of fair housing policies. The \\nCity will publish a final report in fall 2019, which will include \\npolicy solutions and strategies to move us toward a more just and \\ninclusive New York City.\\nSUPPORT EFFORTS TO CREATE NEW HOUSING \\nAND JOBS THROUGHOUT THE REGION \\nNew York City is part of a metropolitan area of 23 million people \\nand 10 million jobs, almost half of which are in the city. Since World \\nWar II, the majority of new housing and job growth in the region \\noccurred in suburban areas. But in the past decade, housing and job \\ngrowth have been concentrated within the city, as more people and \\nbusinesses gravitate to urban neighborhoods.\\n \\nAs the region continues to grow, New York City cannot address the \\nneed for housing and job centers alone. We will work with regional \\npartners to ensure both city and suburbs are growing and thriving \\ntogether. As part of OneNYC, the City launched a first-of-its-kind \\nregional planning division to support collaboration with other \\nmunicipalities, local governments, and local planning departments \\non shared planning challenges. To date, the City has met with \\nmore than 40 regional governments, and routinely works with the \\nplanning leadership group of the region’s largest municipalities, to \\ncreate a region-wide vision of equitable growth. \\nNew York City will deepen collaboration with governments across \\nthe region to address housing affordability. The City will engage in \\na region-wide effort to bring attention to and combat the regional \\nhousing affordability crisis, including providing data analysis \\nto understand changing regional housing needs, and supplying \\ntechnical assistance to regional affordability planning efforts.\\n \\nSEVERE RENT BURDEN AND RACE\\nNeighborhoods where the share of resi-\\ndents who are severely rent burdened is \\ngreater than 30% are outlined in black. \\nAsian\\nRACIAL MAKEUP\\nEach dot represents 50 New Yorkers: \\nRent Burden ACS 5-Year 2017\\nBlack\\nHispanic\\nWhite \\nOther\\nNeighborhoods where more than\\none in three households are\\nseverely rent burdened'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 15.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 14.0 (Windows)', 'creationdate': '2019-04-30T13:48:30-04:00', 'moddate': '2020-01-03T15:55:12-05:00', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'OneNYC_2050_Strategic_Plan.pdf', 'total_pages': 332, 'page': 138, 'page_label': '139'}, page_content='15   |   O neNYC 2050 : THRIVING NEIGHBORHOODS\\nNYC.GOV/O neNYC\\nINITIATIVE 10 OF 30\\nENSURE ALL NEW YORKERS HAVE \\nACCESS TO NEIGHBORHOOD OPEN \\nSPACES AND CULTURAL RESOURCES \\nNEW YORK CITY’S VIBRANT NEIGHBORHOODS ARE DEFINED \\nBY SHARED SPACES: PARKS, PLAZAS, ART VENUES, AND \\nINSTITUTIONS SUCH AS LIBRARIES, AS WELL AS NATURAL \\nLANDSCAPES. \\nParks and open spaces support the health and well-being of \\nevery New Yorker.

They not only circulate millions of books, serving \\nscholars and recreational readers alike, but they are also evolving to \\nmeet the changing needs of neighborhoods and residents. Services \\ninclude after-school and pre-K programming; immigrant, health, \\nand small business services; free internet; and the ability to use \\nWi-Fi hotspots. The library systems are modernizing their spaces \\nto meet the 21st century needs of their users, and, in these efforts, \\nthey will add approximately 133,000 square feet to their physical \\nfootprint. With capital funding from the 2015 Ten-Year Capital \\nPlan, the Brooklyn Public Library has embarked on five full branch \\nrenovations that will further increase the footprint of their public \\nlibrary space. The New York Public Library is utilizing the Ten-Year \\nfunding to fully renovate five historic Carnegie branches in high-\\nneed neighborhoods, including Hunts Point and Melrose in the \\nBronx, Fort Washington and 125th Street in Manhattan, and Port \\nRichmond on Staten Island. The Queens Public Library will open \\nthe new Hunters Point Community Library in summer 2019, while \\nconstruction is underway on the library in Far Rockaway, doubling \\nthe size of its original 1968 building. \\n \\nThe libraries are also continuing to innovate through services such \\nas video visitation, allowing incarcerated people to communicate \\nwith their loved ones at the library through video conferencing, \\nexpanded literacy programs in homeless shelters and jails, and \\nthe launch of Culture Pass, an initiative that provides library \\ncardholders with free access to myriad cultural institutions across \\nthe five boroughs. The Brooklyn Public Library has launched 35 \\nnew staff-driven initiatives, including the first musical instrument \\nlending library in the metro area; the Brooklyn Cookmobile , \\nwhich teaches teens essential skills in cooking and food literacy; \\nFashion Academy, which is a 12-week fashion and business series; \\nand a youth Lego Robotics League. The New York Public Library \\nlaunched a Community Conversations program on relevant topics \\nselected by the community, including civics 101, mental health, \\nthe opioid epidemic, accessibility and inclusion, and more. Also in \\ndirect response to patron need, the New York Public Library has \\ndoubled English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) seats and \\nwitnessed a more than 500 percent increase in ESOL enrollment \\nsince FY 2012. The Queens Public Library’s Tech Lab serves as a hub \\nfor innovation and technology, offering hands-on classes and drop-\\nin access to Adobe Creative Suite, 3D printing, sewing machines, \\nand more. \\nCREATE AND UPGRADE SHARED SPACES TO \\nPROMOTE SOCIAL COHESION AND HOLISTIC \\nSERVICE DELIVERY\\nParks and plazas are not the only places in New York City where \\npeople interact. The City’s storied community gardens, not only \\ngreened abandoned spaces but also sparked a social movement. The \\nhundreds of public library branches spread across the City not only \\nloan books and provide information, but also offer opportunities for \\ncommunity engagement and educational, workforce, and cultural \\nprograms. Furthermore, as the City locates multiple services in a \\nsingle space in order to make them easier to access,  these spaces can \\nplay a similar role. The City is committed to creating and upgrading \\nall types of shared spaces in order to promote social cohesion, \\nparticularly in communities that have historically experienced racial \\ndiscrimination and disinvestment, or that suffer disproportionate \\nhealth burdens. \\n• BUILD COMMUNITY THROUGH STEWARDSHIP AND \\nVOLUNTEERISM \\nNature is a vital asset for promoting social cohesion, therefore \\naccess to nature and stewardship programming to preserve nature \\nare essential. The City’s GreenThumb program, created in 1978, \\nepitomizes community development through stewardship by \\nproviding assistance and coordination to the grassroots community \\ngardening movement. The program now supports 550 groups and \\nis managed by 20,000 volunteers that reflect the diversity of our \\ncity, providing not only green space and food, but also learning \\nopportunities and arts and cultural programming. Looking \\nahead, the City will expand the number of community gardening \\nprojects, and the Art in the Gardens program will activate these \\nspaces by bringing in local artists. Farms at NYCHA is an initiative \\nsupporting urban farms built and maintained by young people \\nliving in public housing, providing healthy food, youth leadership, \\nand employment opportunities. Over the next five years, the City \\nwill expand the number of farms and programming they offer. \\nSupporting these initiatives, the PUREsoil NYC program makes \\nclean soil available to community gardens and other community \\norganizations, and for creating neighborhood stockpiles of soil. \\n• CREATE NEW PLACES FOR PEOPLE TO CONNECT AND ACCESS \\nSERVICES \\nCo-locating government and place-based organizations is a \\nholistic approach to service delivery that can improve the quality \\nof services, create important synergies between organizations, and \\nprovide a physical space for neighbors to connect. For instance, \\nNeighborhood Health Action Centers are revitalizing underutilized \\nCity-owned buildings in Tremont, Brownsville, and East Harlem, \\nby co-locating health services, community health centers, public-\\nhospital clinical services, place-based organizations and service \\nproviders. The four borough-based detention facilities the City will \\nbuild to replace the jails on Rikers Island will be designed to serve \\nas community assets, with publicly accessible spaces and useful \\namenities, such as programming, public services, and street-level \\nretail (for additional detail, see Reimagining Rikers Island sidebar on \\npage 27).

Closing Rikers requires \\nfurther reductions in the jail population and a network of smaller, \\nsafer jails located close to courthouses, families, and service \\nproviders. Both efforts are on track: the City’s jail population is at its \\nlowest level in recent history and declining, and the borough-based \\njail plan is undergoing public review with a final vote expected by \\nthe end of the year.\\nThe closure of Rikers Island by 2027 will be a major step in \\nreforming our criminal justice system. It also presents the City with \\na rare opportunity to repurpose an island of more than 400 acres. \\nRikers is approximately twice the size of Governors Island and could \\nhouse a range of uses for which there is little space in a densely \\npacked city such as New York, freeing up space for community \\nuses in more centrally located neighborhoods. There are some \\nlimitations: The island’s proximity to LaGuardia Airport comes \\nwith height restrictions and noise, and there is limited transit and \\ncar access. Still, the island has tremendous potential to serve New \\nYorkers and help achieve our goals for a fair city.\\nAs we think about the future of Rikers, it is essential that new \\nuses create broad public benefits; help our city meet urgent goals \\nsuch as climate justice, economic equity, and fairness; help redress \\npast harm to justice-impacted communities; and, where possible, \\nimprove waterfront access in this underinvested portion of our \\ncoastline. We must also ensure that all voices are heard and \\nconsidered, including the many New Yorkers impacted by the \\ncriminal justice system. To begin the planning process, the City \\nwill launch a participatory planning effort through which New \\nYorkers will help formulate a vision for the island. This process will \\nformalize guiding principles and priorities for island reuse and study \\nthe viability of potential future uses. This will be the first step in a \\nbroader master planning process.\\nThe City’s priority is to close Rikers Island as soon as possible \\nand create a safe, fair, and humane justice system. As those plans \\nadvance, imagining a new future for Rikers Island provides a chance \\nto help shape a fairer future and provide new opportunity for New \\nYorkers.\\nprogramming to activate neighborhood hot spots.

The core of the plan was, and continues to \\nbe, the Neighborhood Policing philosophy — a complete overhaul \\nof the New York Police Department (NYPD) crime-fighting model \\nthat puts officers in closer connection with people all across the city. \\nAs a result, overall crime, murders, robberies, and burglaries are \\nsubstantially down from their levels five years ago. Simultaneously, \\narrests are down 37 .3 percent, criminal summonses are down 69.9 \\npercent, and stops are down more than 90 percent. A number of \\nactions contributed to this success.\\nBRINGING POLICE AND COMMUNITIES \\nTOGETHER WITH NEIGHBORHOOD POLICING\\n• INVESTING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD POLICING MODEL\\nNeighborhood policing assigns consistent officers to \\nneighborhoods, giving these officers the time and resources \\nto better understand the concerns of residents and work in \\npartnership to solve neighborhood problems. It gives New \\nYorkers better access to the officers charged with serving them, \\nwhile improving and enhancing NYPD’s crime fighting and \\npublic safety capabilities. Investigations are more focused, with \\npatrol officers playing an expanded role in gathering evidence and \\nintelligence through their connections with the neighborhood.\\nTo implement this new model of policing, the City assigned \\n2,000 additional officers in New York City neighborhoods — \\n1,200 new hires and 800 civilian posts — which freed officers for \\nenforcement work. Every neighborhood in New York City now \\nbenefits from this investment.\\n• ENDING THE ERA OF STOP-AND-FRISK ABUSE\\nWe ended the City’s defense of its divisive and counterproductive \\nstop-and-frisk practices, and signed an agreement committing to \\nwork with a monitor appointed by the U.S. Department of Justice \\nto fix the NYPD’s use of stop-and-frisk . The City also commenced \\na joint process with community stakeholders to ensure people \\naffected by stop-and-frisk, particularly communities of color, play \\nan active role in shaping reform.

Working with the City Council, the \\nCity also implemented civil alternatives to criminal sanctions \\nfor violations of open containers and alcohol in public, diverting \\nthousands of individuals from the criminal justice system.   \\nINVESTING IN OFFICER SAFETY AND PRECISION \\nPOLICING\\n• INVESTING IN SMARTER POLICING\\nWorking with the Manhattan District Attorney’s office, the \\nCity gave every officer a smartphone and equipped more than \\n2,000 vehicles with tablets. Community members can call their \\ncommunity officers with tips and concerns, and officers can \\nuse the phones and tablets to resolve issues or offer assistance \\nwithout having to make an arrest or take someone to a precinct.\\n• PROTECTING OFFICERS\\nThe City invested in replacing bulletproof vests for every police \\nofficer. We also outfitted all NYPD vehicles used by uniformed \\npersonnel with ballistic protection. With officers facing the risks \\nof responding to active shooters and terrorism, we made further \\ninvestments to place helmets and ballistic armor at the disposal \\nof every patrol officer.  \\n• PROVIDING BODY-WORN CAMERAS FOR EVERY OFFICER ON \\nPATROL\\nAs part of the agreement that ended stop-and-frisk, the City \\ncommitted to equip NYPD officers with body cameras. All \\nuniformed NYPD patrol officers, in neighborhoods, public \\nhousing developments, and the transit system, have been \\nequipped with body cameras. By the end of 2019, New York City’s \\nbody-worn camera program will be the largest deployment in the \\nworld.\\n• MODERNIZING OFFICER TRAINING\\nThe NYPD fundamentally changed the way it trains new officers \\nand how it continues to train officers throughout their careers. \\nUnder the new training model, recruits in the Academy receive \\na field-training component, and spend six months training with \\ndedicated field-training officers.

CDNAs typically highlight a neighborhood’s business \\nlandscape, consumer characteristics, physical environment, \\nand demographic data to develop recommendations for \\nmerchant organizing, public programming, district marketing \\nand branding, streetscape enhancements, business support \\nservices, and other quality of life improvements.\\n• MAYOR’S ACTION PLAN FOR NEIGHBORHOOD SAFETY \\n(MAP) is a targeted, comprehensive approach to reduce violent \\ncrime in and around the 15 public housing developments that \\ncomprise almost 20 percent of violent crime in the City’s public \\nhousing. Through MAP and its associated initiative  Building \\nHealthy Communities, which encompasses the neighborhoods \\nsurrounding the MAP developments, the City is investing \\nin people through the strengthening of social supports and \\nyouth employment opportunities, investing in places through \\nrevitalization of physical infrastructure and increased \\nopportunities for recreation and beautification.  \\n• NEIGHBORHOOD HEALTH ACTION CENTERS  take previously \\nunderutilized City-owned buildings and use these spaces to \\nhouse government social services, place-based programs, and \\nclinical providers under one roof, with the goal of improving \\nthe health of residents in neighborhoods with poor health \\noutcomes. \\n• HPD’S OFFICE OF NEIGHBORHOOD STRATEGIES works with \\ncommunities to plan for the preservation and development of \\naffordable housing in a manner that fosters more equitable, \\ndiverse, and livable neighborhoods. As part of this process, \\nHPD convenes Community Visioning Workshops, and has \\npublished plans for Brownsville, Brooklyn and Edgemere, \\nQueens. \\n• COMMUNITY HEALTH PROFILES , developed by the \\nDepartment of Health and Mental Hygiene, provide critical \\ninformation about what creates healthy living and what makes \\nit hard to stay healthy in each of the City’s 59 community \\ndistricts. By using the profiles to inform local planning and \\ndecision-making, neighborhood stakeholders and City agencies \\ncan ensure planning decisions improve the health and well-\\nbeing of local residents. \\n• RESILIENT NEIGHBORHOODS is a place-based planning \\ninitiative to identify neighborhood-specific strategies, including \\nzoning and land use changes, to support the vitality and \\nresiliency of communities in the floodplain and prepare them for \\nfuture storms.\\nInwood PlanInwood Plan\\nEast Harlem PlanEast Harlem Plan\\nEast New York PlanEast New York Plan\\nDowntown Far Rockaway PlanDowntown Far Rockaway Plan\\nEdgemere Neighborhood PlanEdgemere Neighborhood Plan\\nGowanus PlanGowanus Plan\\nBay Street Corridor PlanBay Street Corridor Plan\\nJerome Avenue PlanJerome Avenue Plan\\nBrownsville Neighborhood PlanBrownsville Neighborhood Plan\\nGreater East Midtown Plan Greater East Midtown Plan \\nSoHo NoHo Study AreaSoHo NoHo Study Area\\nSpecial Hudson River Park DistrictSpecial Hudson River Park District\\nNorth Brooklyn Study AreaNorth Brooklyn Study Area Jamaica NowJamaica Now\\nNYCEDC Sunset Park DistrictNYCEDC Sunset Park District\\nBushwick StudyBushwick Study\\nLower ConcourseLower Concourse\\nSunnyside YardsSunnyside Yards'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 15.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 14.0 (Windows)', 'creationdate': '2019-04-30T13:48:30-04:00', 'moddate': '2020-01-03T15:55:12-05:00', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'OneNYC_2050_Strategic_Plan.pdf', 'total_pages': 332, 'page': 154, 'page_label': '155'}, page_content='NYC.GOV/O neNYC\\nThe City is advancing a holistic and community-informed ap-\\nproach to planning in neighborhoods throughout New York City. \\nSince 2014, the City has completed place-based planning initia-\\ntives designed to coordinate investment and address  \\ncommunity and citywide needs.

Discriminatory \\npolicies such as redlining, as well as a lack of investment in \\nneighborhood sustainability, have historically disadvantaged \\nmany communities, particularly low- income communities of \\ncolor, leaving these communities without adequate local services, \\nhousing, parks, or playgrounds, which contribute to health.   \\nStudies show income inequality and high rates of poverty \\nare connected to poorer health outcomes such as reduced \\nlife expectancy, and increased infant mortality, obesity, and \\nmental illness. Life expectancy in East Harlem, where residents \\nare predominantly black and Hispanic, and poverty is more \\nprevalent, is 8.6 years shorter than on the Upper East Side, a \\npredominantly white community with lower poverty just a few \\nblocks south. Black women are eight times more likely to die from \\npregnancy-related causes than white women, and babies born to \\nblack mothers are three times as likely to die in their first year of \\nlife as babies born to white mothers.\\nBy adopting a holistic approach with OneNYC, we will address \\na range of factors that impact our health. These include gun \\nviolence and traffic fatalities, intensive heat waves due to climate \\nchange, and air pollution that exacerbates heart and lung \\nproblems, particularly for children with asthma. \\nPROGRESS\\n \\nWE CANNOT ACHIEVE HEALTH EQUITY WITHOUT \\nGUARANTEEING THE RIGHT TO QUALITY HEALTH CARE, AND \\nENROLLING AS MANY NEW YORKERS AS POSSIBLE IN HEALTH \\nINSURANCE. New York City has steadily reduced the number of \\nuninsured residents since the Affordable Care Act was launched \\nin 2013 — with nearly 70,000 enrolled in the past year alone  — \\nbut there are still an estimated 600,000 New Yorkers without \\nhealth insurance, and roughly 300,000 of them are considered \\n“uninsurable.” We are working to ensure all New Yorkers can \\naccess high quality primary care, regardless of their immigration \\nstatus, through NYC Care.\\nThe City has also launched initiatives to protect residents from \\nthe harmful effects of tobacco use, redoubled efforts to end the \\nAIDS epidemic, and created new air quality standards. We have \\nstarted programs to expand mental health services and combat \\nthe opioid epidemic. Child exposure to lead has dropped by 90 \\npercent since 2005.\\n \\nIn addition, the City has begun confronting pervasive racial and \\nethnic inequities in maternal morbidity and mortality, and infant \\nmortality, launching a comprehensive strategy to improve health \\noutcomes for mothers and babies, especially among women of \\ncolor. Much of the focus has been on community health, with \\npolicies and programs informed by community members. Our \\nNeighborhood Health Action Centers, for example, include \\nWomen's Health Suites, and also provide services ranging from \\nprimary care and mental health care to wellness classes and are \\nconnected to neighborhood-based social services.\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 15.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 14.0 (Windows)', 'creationdate': '2019-04-30T13:48:30-04:00', 'moddate': '2020-01-03T15:55:12-05:00', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'OneNYC_2050_Strategic_Plan.pdf', 'total_pages': 332, 'page': 168, 'page_label': '169'}, page_content='7   |   O neNYC 2050 : HEALTHY LIVES\\nNYC.GOV/O neNYC\\nWHAT WE HEARD FROM  \\nNEW YORKERS\\nOF THE MORE THAN 14,000 RESPONDENTS TO OUR \\nCITYWIDE SURVEY, 29 PERCENT SELECTED HEALTH \\nCARE AS ONE OF THE CITY’S GREATEST CHALLENGES. \\nThe key themes expressed include a call for affordable \\nand universal health care, better access to care at the \\nlocal neighborhood level, and targeted support for \\nmarginalized groups, including the need for better \\nsystems to help those dealing with mental health \\nissues.

In \\naddition to expanding shade and tree-canopy cover, the City and \\npartners have increased the albedo — the reflection of the sun’s \\nlight and heat — to more than 9 million square feet of building \\nroofs. Still, each year, hundreds of New Yorkers experience heat-\\nrelated injuries and deaths, with most exposed at homes without \\nair conditioning. Heat vulnerability is highest in low-income \\nneighborhoods and communities of color where discriminatory \\npolicies have resulted in inequitable distribution of social and \\neconomic resources and opportunities.

The \\nCity will continue to reduce and prevent pollution to protect the \\nharbor and connected waterways through capital investments, \\nregulation, and partnerships with community groups and \\nindustry. \\n• EXPAND THE GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM  \\nGreen infrastructure softens the city’s built environment, \\nnaturally absorbing stormwater and diverting it from the \\nsewers and wastewater treatment plants. The New York City \\nDepartment of Environmental Protection (DEP) has constructed \\nmore than 4,000 green infrastructure assets, including rain \\ngardens and permeable pavers. To further this effort, the City \\nwill partner with other City agencies to expand the right-of-way \\nprogram into medians and other new areas, launch an incentive \\nprogram for private property, and launch an “Adopt-a-Rain \\nGarden” program. In addition, DEP will expand the Mid-Island \\nBluebelt (a wetland that receives and filters stormwater) in Staten \\nIsland, and explore opportunities to install Bluebelts in other \\nadvantageous locations citywide.\\n \\n• EXPAND SEWER INFRASTRUCTURE IN UNDERSERVED \\nAREAS \\nSome parts of the City lack a completely built-out sewer \\nsystem and often experience street flooding. In 2015, the City \\nlaunched an unprecedented investment of $1.5 billion over \\n10 years to expand the sewer network in Southeast Queens, \\nwhich will help mitigate flooding. The City will continue to \\nuse this investment to expand access to sewer infrastructure in \\ncurrently underserved areas.\\n \\n• IMPLEMENT WATER RECIRCULATION PROJECTS  \\nDEP is becoming a leader in resource recovery and an essential \\npartner in the circular economy. Every year, City-owned \\nproperties use drinking water for activities wherein recycled \\nwater could be used, such as irrigation and refilling lakes \\ninside public parks. To conserve potable water, the City will \\nimplement water recirculation projects in Central Park. \\nProjects such as this will encourage large water consumers to \\nsubstitute at least some of their potable water with recycled \\nwater, which will reduce both demand for drinking water \\nresources and water discharged into New York Harbor.\\n \\n• REDUCE FLOATABLES IN CITY WATERS \\nIn early 2019, DEP launched “Fatberg Free NYC” a public \\nawareness campaign to discourage the improper disposal of \\ngrease, “flushable” toilet wipes, and other items such as floss \\nand paper towels, called “Trash it. Don’t Flush it.”  Working \\nwith local communities, DEP will continue its work to reduce \\n“floatables” through targeted beach and park clean ups, anti-\\nlitter advertisements, and a plastic-bag exchange program.\\nFATBERGS FORM WHEN GREASE, WIPES, AND OTHER STUFF GET FLUSHED, CLOGGING PIPES AND DRAINING WALLETS. \\nSource: City of New York'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 15.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 14.0 (Windows)', 'creationdate': '2019-04-30T13:48:30-04:00', 'moddate': '2020-01-03T15:55:12-05:00', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'OneNYC_2050_Strategic_Plan.pdf', 'total_pages': 332, 'page': 189, 'page_label': '190'}, page_content='28   |   O neNYC 2050 : HEALTHY LIVES\\nNYC.GOV/O neNYC\\nPROTECT, RESTORE, AND CONSERVE THE \\nCITY’S NATURAL ENVIRONMENT \\nNew York City is located in an estuary, where ocean and river \\nmeet to create a highly productive ecosystem. While it is not \\nalways apparent, the metropolitan area is home to abundant \\nplant and animal life. Yet New York’s ecological history is not a \\nsimple tale of decline, as evidenced by improving air and water \\nquality and the recent return of wildlife. We must carefully \\nconserve and manage our natural environment to strengthen our \\nregion’s ecology and cultural heritage. Long-term conservation \\nof our wild natural areas is also an essential part of New York \\nCity becoming resilient in the face of climate change. At the same \\ntime, we can make these beautiful spaces more accessible for New \\nYorkers to enjoy. \\n \\n• MANAGE AND REVITALIZE NEW YORK CITY’S URBAN \\nFOREST \\nOur urban forest, composed of trees in streets, parks, and \\nforested areas, offers many benefits for New York City. Trees \\nabsorb carbon dioxide and remove air pollutants, lower \\nsummertime temperatures, provide shade, and help retain \\nstormwater. To protect, maintain, and enhance the city’s \\ntree canopy, the City will continue to implement its Forest \\nManagement Framework, a long-term plan to fully support \\nmanagement and restoration efforts in forested natural areas \\ncitywide. We will plant street trees in neighborhoods with high \\nvulnerability to heat, and, on streets and in parks, replace trees \\nthat die or are downed by extreme weather and pests (see more \\nin Thriving Neighborhoods ).\\n• INCREASE ACCESS TO THE CITY’S NATURAL AREAS \\nThe City will make a concerted effort to make its natural areas \\nmore accessible to New Yorkers, beginning with an analysis of \\nimpediments and opportunities to experience natural areas \\nthat examines factors such as access points, public transit \\nroutes, proximity to communities, and trail signage.  \\n \\nThe City will also expand environmental education \\nby highlighting the city’s diverse ecosystems in school \\ncurriculums, and continue to offer Urban Park Ranger \\nprogramming to connect youth to natural areas through \\nnature-based activities and hikes. We will continue to \\nstandardize and improve walking trails in parks with sensitive \\necosystems to improve accessibility and reduce environmental \\nimpacts. The City will also develop illustrative wayfinding \\nguidance to make natural areas easily navigable and welcoming \\nto diverse audiences.  \\n \\nThe City is advancing initiatives to manage, protect, and \\nrestore coastal and freshwater wetlands and streams, which \\nprovide such benefits as neighborhood cooling, habitat for \\nfish and wildlife, and opportunities for recreation and access \\nto nature. Tibbetts Brook, in particular, represents a great \\nopportunity for the City to restore a vital natural area to \\ngreater ecological health while simultaneously providing \\nrecreational benefits through a greenway. This conservation \\nand education work is complemented by WildlifeNYC, the \\nCity’s initiative to raise public awareness about how to safely \\nenjoy — and coexist with — the hundreds of different species \\nthat call New York City home.\\nNYC NATURE GOALS 2050\\nTHE NATURAL AREAS CONSERVANCY, with the NYC Parks \\nDepartment, convened a coalition of more than 75 organizations \\nfrom different sectors and disciplines including academia, \\nnonprofits, government, local stewards and environmental \\njustice groups, and the private sector to advance the cause of \\nurban nature in New York City. Over five years, the coalition \\nmet frequently to develop shared goals and targets, based \\non the common belief that urban nature is vital to both our \\ncollective wellness and happiness, and the sustainability of our \\ncity. The coalition also wrote a Declaration of Rights to New \\nYork City Nature: a bill of rights for good local nature. The \\nconnective tissue among all the participating organization is five \\nfoundational conservation and restoration goals. They include:\\n \\n• Support for biodiversity and habitat\\n• Provision and enhancement of clean air and water\\n• Resilience and protection from coastal storms\\n• Connectivity for plants and animals\\n• Inspiration for city residents\\n \\nTo achieve the five principal goals by 2050, the Nature \\nGoals coalition also identified 25 actionable targets to guide \\nconservation efforts in New York City. The overall aim of the \\ncoalition is to ensure all New Yorkers experience the benefits of \\nnature in their home city and local community by 2050.

The Bayside \\nNature Trail provides an opportunity for increased access to \\npublic lands and the waterfront, while creating new recreational \\nopportunities for residents and visitors.\\nIn 2018, the Jamaica Bay-Rockaway Parks Conservancy — in \\npartnership with the Department of Parks and Recreation, the \\nNew York State Department of Parks, Recreation, and Historic \\nPreservation, and the Natural Areas Conservancy — funded and \\nimplemented a project to improve trails in Jamaica Bay Park. \\nThis work included the construction of a new bayside walking \\ntrail and improvements to existing trails within the park, along \\nwith invasive-plant removal and erosion-control measures. The \\nnew trail also linked the City park to the adjacent Bayswater \\nPoint State Park, adding 3,000 feet of new trails and forming a \\ncontiguous trail network nearly a mile in length. In the coming \\nyear, additional restoration work will take place along the \\nshoreline and upland area adjacent to the trail, which will focus \\non removing invasive plant species and seeding native maritime \\nplants.\\nThe new Jamaica Bay park trail is part of a larger trail network \\nconnecting parks and open spaces within Rockaway to one \\nanother, allowing for better park and waterfront access for local \\nresidents and visitors. The Bayside Nature Trail will increase \\naccess to many new or renovated parks across the Rockaway \\nPeninsula, which are funded by over $100M in FEMA funds \\nfollowing Hurricane Sandy and other local sources.\\n29   |   O neNYC 2050 : HEALTHY LIVES'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 15.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 14.0 (Windows)', 'creationdate': '2019-04-30T13:48:30-04:00', 'moddate': '2020-01-03T15:55:12-05:00', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'OneNYC_2050_Strategic_Plan.pdf', 'total_pages': 332, 'page': 191, 'page_label': '192'}, page_content='30   |   O neNYC 2050 : HEALTHY LIVES\\nNYC.GOV/O neNYC\\nTHE PATH FORWARD \\nTO ACHIEVE OUR GOALS, WE MUST HAVE A PLAN AND HOLD OURSELVES ACCOUNTABLE.

A child who could benefit from a free 3-K pro-\\ngram cannot find an available seat in their neigh-\\nborhood. A student at a high school without access \\nto restorative practices is removed from class and \\nmisses key instructional time. \\nNot all of our classrooms are created or valued \\nequally. Inequities exist in the way resources are \\ndistributed to some classrooms. Further, New \\nYorkers’ opinions about a school are often informed \\nby where a school is located or the demographics \\nof the students in that school. As a result, many \\nschools that are located in or serve students who \\ncome from historically underserved communities \\nare unfairly written off as lacking, while schools in \\nmiddle to upper income, white communities are \\nperceived to be of high quality. The reality is excel-\\nlent schools with dedicated staff exist in all of our \\ncommunities. \\nOneNYC 2050 lays out a strategy to continue our \\nCity’s work of building a school system that ensures \\nstudents in every borough, district, neighborhood, \\nand school have the tools they need to achieve their \\ndreams. In this plan, we formulate policies based \\non our understanding that excellence is more than \\na goal, it is the birthright of every child in our city. \\nOneNYC 2050 lays out our commitment to doing \\nthe hard work that truly delivers the promise that \\nevery child, no matter who their parents are or \\nwhat zip code they live in, deserves an excellent \\neducation.\\nINDICATORS  \\nNEW YORK CITY WILL MEASURE PROGRESS BY TRACKING THE FOLLOWING INDICATORS:W\\nINDICATOR LATEST DATA TARGET\\nCHILDREN WITH ACCESS TO 3-K ~5,000\\n(2018) 100%\\nLITERACY BY SECOND GRADE (THIRD GRADE ELA AS PROXY) 50.6%\\n(2018) 100% BY 2026\\nNEW YORKERS WHO GRADUATE ON TIME 75.9%\\n(2018) 84% BY 2026\\nTEACHERS WHO RECEIVE IMPLICIT BIAS TRAINING 10,000\\n(2018) ALL'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 15.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 14.0 (Windows)', 'creationdate': '2019-04-30T13:48:30-04:00', 'moddate': '2020-01-03T15:55:12-05:00', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'OneNYC_2050_Strategic_Plan.pdf', 'total_pages': 332, 'page': 201, 'page_label': '202'}, page_content='NYC.GOV/O neNYC\\n6   |   OneNYC 2050 : EQUITY AND EXCELLENCE IN EDUCATION\\nCONTEXT\\nTHE NEW YORK CITY SCHOOL SYSTEM IS THE LARGEST IN THE \\nCOUNTRY, WITH MORE THAN ONE MILLION STUDENTS IN MORE \\nTHAN 1,800 SCHOOLS. This sprawling system includes many \\noutstanding schools that for decades have provided a springboard \\nfor students’ self-actualization and social mobility. However, the \\nlegacy of government-facilitated housing segregation has created a \\nsystem wherein too many of our neighborhood schools are socio-\\neconomically, academically, and racially segregated.\\nThis segregated system, together with both underinvestment in \\nthe city’s communities of color and academic screens historically \\nrooted in excluding entire populations of students, has led to \\nstark inequities in our public schools. Neighborhoods with large \\nnumbers of students of color (especially those with disabilities) and \\nlow-income families have borne the disproportionate burden of \\npunitive suspension and disciplinary practices, inadequate learning \\nfacilities, and limited access to advanced placement (AP) courses.\\nEnsuring every child has access to an excellent school requires a \\ncommitment to addressing the root causes of inequality, while \\nredoubling our efforts to ensure every New York City child has \\naccess to the resources they need to thrive from birth until \\ngraduation. \\nPROGRESS\\nNEW YORK CITY’S PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM HAS MADE \\nSUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS SINCE 2002, WHEN THE STATE \\nLEGISLATURE ENACTED MAYORAL ACCOUNTABILITY OVER \\nCITY EDUCATION. The shift away from the prior system — \\nwhich was bankrupt and devoid of an overarching vision — to \\none focused on what is actually best for all kids, has led to more \\ninvestment, equity-focused policies, and positive momentum \\ntoward expanding educational opportunities and improving \\noutcomes. In addition, to improve the way it works with students, \\nparents, and communities, the Department of Education (DOE) \\nhas realigned its structure, bringing leadership in closer contact \\nwith students and teachers, and establishing clear lines of \\ncommunication and accountability.\\nSince Pre-K for All launched in 2014, the City has more than tripled \\nthe number of children in free, full-day, high-quality pre-K, with \\nnearly 70,000 four-year-olds enrolled today, compared with 19,000 in \\n2014. Today, after starting in two districts, 3-K for All provides free, \\nfull-day, high-quality early childhood education to more than 5,000 \\nthree-year-olds in six districts in New York City. We are outpacing \\nour rollout schedule, with as many as 20,000 three-year-olds \\nexpected to be enrolled in 14 districts within all five boroughs by \\n2020. We continue to expand access to bilingual and dual-language \\nprograms, career and technical education, sports programs, and \\npostsecondary opportunities as we develop holistic approaches to \\nimprove the way we teach all learners. Suspensions are down across \\nthe board. In 2018, we saw the highest-ever number of New York \\nCity students taking and passing AP exams, with more than a 10 \\npercent jump in students taking — and students passing — at least \\none AP course over the previous year.\\nSeventy-six percent of students graduated high school in 2018, \\nthe highest rate in the city’s history, and we are well on our way \\nto exceeding the original target of 80 percent by 2026. In fact, \\nwe will raise the target to 84 percent by 2026, in line with the \\nnational high school graduation average of 84.6 percent. At 7 .5 \\npercent, the class of 2018 also had the lowest dropout rate of any \\nclass since New York State started keeping records. \\nWe are increasing college readiness, with 70 percent of students \\ntoday prepared for higher education, compared with just 47 percent \\nfive years ago, and nearly 60 percent of the class of 2017 (around \\n45,000 students) having enrolled in college. Overall, the baseline \\nexperience of what it means to be educated in New York City has \\nincreased dramatically, with more low-income students of color \\noffered opportunities long enjoyed by their more financially well-\\noff peers. Today, every student has access to more educational \\nopportunities than those of a generation ago — from birth to  high \\nschool graduation.\\nThe Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are the global \\nblueprint adopted by all countries at the United Nations \\nto achieve a better and more sustainable future for all, \\nencompassing strategies to end poverty, improve health \\nand education, reduce inequality, spur economic growth, \\nand tackle climate change.

For black students, \\nthe gap narrowed from 17 percent in 2014 to 12 percent in \\n2018 compared with white peers. For Hispanic students, the \\ngap narrowed from 19 percent in 2014 to 14 percent in 2018 \\ncompared with their white peers. Overall, gaps in student \\noutcomes from graduation rates to test scores correlate too \\nclosely to race/ethnicity, disability, socioeconomic status, and \\nlanguage. We continue to work toward a future when these gaps \\nno longer exist.\\nWe must view every school, no matter what community it is in \\nor what kinds of students it serves, as a place where all students \\ncan and will succeed. To remake our school system around this \\nvision, we will focus on expanding early childhood development \\nprograms, achieving the highest on-time high school graduation \\nrates in line with the national average, improving college \\nreadiness, and, by 2026, achieving universal literacy by the second \\ngrade.

The proposed plan \\nallocates $750 million to make schools more accessible, which is \\nby far the most ever spent by the City to achieve this goal. The \\nimprovements, developed with families and advocates for people \\nwith disabilities, will add accessible bathrooms, classrooms, and \\nauditoriums, and offer more opportunities for students with \\naccessibility needs to learn in an equitable environment.

Algebra is widely recognized as the “gatekeeper” to \\nhigher-level math and science courses, and students who pass \\nAlgebra I by no later than the end of ninth grade are more \\nlikely to graduate from high school as well as college. Classes \\nin computer science are critical to success in nearly all fields, \\nfrom medicine and technology to the humanities. Providing \\naccess to these classes along with AP is especially important \\nfor low-income students and students of color who would \\nnot otherwise be exposed to college-level coursework. Along \\nwith greater preparedness for college-level work, the potential \\nto earn credit toward college courses through qualifying AP \\ntest scores gives students a head start in their postsecondary \\neducation. \\nAlgebra for All launched in 2016 to improve elementary- and \\nmiddle-school math instruction and ensure that all students \\ncomplete Algebra by the end of the ninth grade. The program \\npartners with districts to build teacher capacity in the subject.\\nAP for All, also launched in 2016, enables every high school \\nstudent to access a range of AP courses. More than 55,000 \\nstudents — a record — have already taken at least one AP exam, \\nwith increases in every borough and across ethnic groups. \\nAP for All has driven citywide gains in participation and \\nperformance, particularly among black and Hispanic students. \\nBy fall 2021, students at all high schools will have access to at \\nleast five AP classes.\\nThe Computer Science for All initiative, launched in fall 2015, \\nis a public-private partnership to provide every student with \\na computer science education — including coding, robotics, \\nand web design — in elementary, middle, and high school. Too \\nmany students in New York City public schools either lack \\naccess to computer science or gain it too late, after biases and \\nstereotypes have formed. Approximately 134,000 students \\nparticipated in computer science at more than 500 schools in \\n2017–2018 school year. Seven hundred schools had at least one \\nteacher trained in computer science. More than 5,000 students \\ntook an AP computer science exam that year, and some 1,600 \\nteachers have received training over the course of the program. \\nBy 2025, all New York City public school students at each school \\nlevel will receive high-quality computer science education. \\nSTUDENTS TAKING A TEST AT EDWARD R.

While New York City students are \\ngraduating from high school and enrolling in college in record \\nnumbers, many still face a gap when it comes to gaining the \\nlanguage skills and knowledge needed to navigate the college \\napplication process successfully. Too often, access to this \\nknowledge depends on family members and friends who are \\nthemselves college students, which means students with these \\nexperiences have earlier exposure to college compared with those \\nwho only learn about it late into high school. \\nLaunched in 2016, the College Access for All initiative is aimed at \\nensuring every student has the resources and support to apply to \\nand enter college. The program helps students prepare to engage \\nwith the college process, starting in middle school with seventh- \\ngrade visits to college campuses and going through high school, \\nwith support for 12th graders taking SAT exams and filling out \\ncollege and financial aid applications. In the 2017–2018 school \\nyear, 350 middle schools in 22 districts participated in college \\naccess programming. In 2018–2019, we provided college access \\nprogramming to middle schools in every district. \\n \\nAdditionally, starting this school year, every high school will \\nprovide resources and support for students to graduate with a \\ncollege and career plan.

We have made an effort to diversify our schools, \\nwith district-led initiatives currently underway in Districts \\n1, 3, and 15. However, increasing diversity in schools is not \\naccomplished by simply reconfiguring a school’s demographic \\nmakeup. A 21st century school segregation problem will not be \\nsolved with 20th century solutions. We must move away from \\nthinking that improving education through integration relies \\non a one-way stream of students of color being bused into \\npredominantly white neighborhoods, or vice versa. \\nWe recognize that creating truly diverse schools requires a \\nlong-term reckoning with the history of government-sanctioned \\nredlining and the resulting entrenched housing patterns that \\ndetermine the makeup of each school’s population, as well as \\nimproving the learning culture for students of color, ensuring \\nall parts of a student’s identity are respected by school staff and \\nreflected in the curriculums. The call for a broader approach to \\nincreasing diversity was a key finding by Mayor de Blasio and \\nthe School Diversity Advisory Group (SDAG), which formed in \\n2017, as a part of Equity and Excellence for All, to make policy \\nrecommendations to the Mayor and schools chancellor. In \\nline with the report, we also realize the terms “diversity” and \\n“identity” do not simply refer to race. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, \\ntransgender, queer, and questioning (LGBTQ) students have \\nhistorically been underserved in school environments, from \\nun-affirming curriculums to suspensions, biased teachers, and \\nbullying.

We will advance the inclusion of students of all gender \\nidentities and sexual orientations through affirming curriculums \\nand anti-violence education. Teachers will be trained in how to \\ncreate more equitable, culturally responsive curriculums, and \\nconfront their own implicit biases.

As such, it is imperative that teachers are aware of \\ntheir own implicit biases and actively resist the impulse to bring \\nsocially constructed prejudices and traditions of inequitable \\ntreatment into the classroom. This promotes more caring \\nand compassionate teachers and safer classrooms, facilitates \\nrelationship-building between students and teachers, and creates \\nspaces where students can feel safe and take intellectual risks. \\nTo that end, the City will invest $23 million in implicit bias \\ntraining for all teachers, reaching far beyond just schools with \\ndisproportionate suspension and discipline trends. \\nADVANCE THE DIVERSITY GRANTS PROGRAM\\nBecause all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools \\nand classrooms, we are committed to creating and supporting \\nlearning environments that reflect the diversity of New York City. \\nIncreasing the enrollment of students from varied socioeconomic \\nand racial/ethnic backgrounds in demographically homogeneous \\nschools is an important part of our commitment to diversity. \\nWhile this alone is not sufficient to achieve an inclusive school \\nsystem, efforts should be made toward diversifying enrollment \\nacross schools. That’s why we launched a $2 million grant \\nprogram in fall 2018 to help support grassroots, district-level \\nefforts to develop diversity plans. Plans are also being developed \\nin Districts 1, 3, and 15 to engage communities to create diversity \\nplans tailored to their needs. Those may include opening a family \\nresource center to support families in the school application \\nprocess, providing more equitable access to low-income and \\nlower-performing students, or eliminating academic screens for \\nmiddle school admissions. \\nPROVIDE STUDENTS WITH GREATER ACCESS \\nTO RESTORATIVE JUSTICE \\nWe believe children learn best when they’re in the classroom. \\nYet for too many students, especially those who are black or \\nHispanic, youthful misbehaviors result in suspensions and other \\npunitive discipline practices instead of serving as an opportunity \\nto learn, make amends, and ultimately feel closer to and more \\nsupported by their school community. Restorative justice practice \\nis an effective, sustainable, and equitable alternative to punitive \\nand racially marginalizing discipline practices, and helps students \\ndevelop character, problem-solve, and build better relationships \\nwith all members of their school community. Piloted by DOE \\nduring the 2016–2017 school year in District 18, the program led \\nto a 25 percent decline in suspensions, compared with 6 percent \\ncitywide, at the end of 2017 . Restorative justice practices have \\nalso been funded in schools across three districts. Through open \\ncommunity dialogue, and acknowledgement of their emotions \\n— rather than punitive and academically detrimental exclusion \\nfrom school — students are given space to learn how to assess \\nharm, practice self-regulation, repair relationships, overcome \\nconflict, and refine their social-emotional skills. As a result, \\nstudents and their school communities are able to move forward \\nfrom every incident in a stronger and more supportive learning \\nenvironment.\\n“We need to add life skills to our education curriculums, \\nso our kids develop the necessary tools to grow up to be \\nresponsible for themselves and their communities.” \\n– Resident of Chelsea, Manhattan'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 15.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 14.0 (Windows)', 'creationdate': '2019-04-30T13:48:30-04:00', 'moddate': '2020-01-03T15:55:12-05:00', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'OneNYC_2050_Strategic_Plan.pdf', 'total_pages': 332, 'page': 218, 'page_label': '219'}, page_content='NYC.GOV/O neNYC\\n23   |   OneNYC 2050 : EQUITY AND EXCELLENCE IN EDUCATION\\nSELF-\\nAWARENESS\\nSELF-\\nMANAGEMENT\\nRELATIONSHIP\\nSKILLS\\nSOCIAL & \\nEMOTIONAL \\nLEARNING\\nHOMES AND \\nCOMMUNITIES\\nSEL CURRICULUM \\n& INSTRUCTION\\nSCHOOLWIDE PRACTICES \\n& POLICIES\\nFAMILY & COMMUNITY\\nPARTNERSHIPS\\nSCHOOLS\\nCLASSROOMS\\nSOCIAL \\nAWARENESS\\nRESPONSIBLE DECISION-MAKING\\nSOCIO-EMOTIONAL  \\nLEARNING (SEL)\\nRestorative justice practices activate social-emotional learning \\nskills by teaching students how to solve problems and repair \\nrelationships.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 15.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 14.0 (Windows)', 'creationdate': '2019-04-30T13:48:30-04:00', 'moddate': '2020-01-03T15:55:12-05:00', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'OneNYC_2050_Strategic_Plan.pdf', 'total_pages': 332, 'page': 219, 'page_label': '220'}, page_content='NYC.GOV/O neNYC\\n24   |   OneNYC 2050 : EQUITY AND EXCELLENCE IN EDUCATION\\nENSURE INCLUSION FOR STUDENTS OF \\nALL GENDER IDENTITIES AND SEXUAL \\nORIENTATIONS\\nNew York City schools are at the forefront of efforts to create \\na safe and supportive environment for students of all gender \\nexpressions and identities. Examples of this work include \\nproviding access to resources for transgender and gender \\nnon-binary students, and sexual health education that affirms \\nstudents of all gender expressions, identities, and sexual \\norientations. With these efforts, we combat gender-based biases, \\nfrom relationship abuse to transphobic policies, that act as \\nbarriers to receiving an excellent education.\\n• IMPLEMENTING HEALTH ED WORKS  \\nComprehensive sexual health education is fundamental to \\nthe wellness of students. Our programs incorporate medically \\naccurate, affirming, age-appropriate, and culturally competent \\ninformation about anatomy, physiology, family involvement, \\npersonal safety, healthy relationships, sexually transmitted \\ninfections such as HIV, contraceptives, sexual orientation, \\npregnancy, media navigation and literacy, and more. In 2018, \\nthe City launched Health Ed Works, a four-year, $24 million \\ninitiative to increase comprehensive, medically accurate, \\nand age-appropriate health education resources for students. \\nThe program provides additional professional-development \\nopportunities for teachers, increases family and community \\nengagement around health education, and offers individualized \\nsupport to 500 targeted schools. \\n• SUPPORTING LGBTQ STUDENTS, FAMILIES, AND STAFF  \\nLGBTQ youth experience nearly twice as much bullying \\non school property as cisgender and heterosexual youth, \\nand are more than twice as likely to attempt suicide. LGBTQ \\nyouth of color may also experience stress related to racism and \\ndiscrimination. Supporting all students, regardless of sexual \\norientation or gender identity, is a key part of our mission to \\nensure Equity and Excellence for All. \\n \\nTo achieve this goal, DOE’s Office of Counseling Support \\nPrograms has hired an LGBT community liaison and gender \\nequity coordinator to expand supports for the community. These \\nprograms include:\\n• COMMUNITY BASED RESOURCES  \\nThe LGBT Advisory Council, established in 2014, solves issues \\nof LGBTQ inequity across the five boroughs. The Council’s \\n40 partners include community based organizations, City \\nagencies, and DOE offices. \\n• SUPPORTIVE ADULTS  \\nTo date, the LGBTQ community liaison and gender equity \\ncoordinators have trained more than 4,000 school-based and \\ncentral staff members. Through funding from the City Council, \\nmore than 450 school-based staff members were trained at the \\nannual Sexuality, Women, and Gender (SWAG) Conference. \\nBecause students who feel supported are more likely to attend \\nschool, we have implemented the OUT for Safe Schools \\nprogram, which allows teachers to identify themselves as visible \\nallies by wearing a badge in school, and has been rolled out to \\nhundreds of staff citywide.\\n• INCLUSIVE POLICIES  \\nDOE has been a leader in creating policies supporting \\nLGBTQ students. In March 2014, DOE released its first-\\never Transgender Student Guidelines. In March 2017, the \\nDepartment issued expanded and updated transgender and \\ngender non-conforming student guidelines in collaboration \\nwith City agencies and community-based organizations. We are \\ncommitted to recognizing and supporting our trans students \\nand ensuring they receive an equitable education.\\n• AFFIRMING CURRICULUMS  \\nStudents with access to developmentally appropriate \\ncurriculum resources that include LGBTQ content are less \\nlikely to be bullied or called names. Through funding from \\nthe City Council, schools have been able to participate in the \\nLambda Literary LGBTQ Writers in Schools Program. The \\ninaugural program paired 80 teachers with an LGBTQ author, \\nprovided copies of all of that author’s books, and brought the \\nauthor into the classroom. \\n• LGBTQ STUDENT CLUBS  \\nClubs such as gender and sexuality alliances (GSAs) create \\nspaces for LGBTQ students to socialize, support one another, \\nand advocate for inclusive practices in their schools.

These disasters killed \\nhundreds, displaced many more, and resulted in hundreds of billions \\nof dollars in damages and lost economic activity. \\nAnd it will only get worse. As a result of climate change, we will see \\ndisruptions in the global food supply as flood, droughts, and pests \\ndamage crops, and ocean fisheries collapse from acidification and \\noxygen depletion; mass migrations — particularly of communities \\ndependent on agricultural or coastal livelihoods — as whole regions \\nbecome uninhabitable; impacts on human health with more heat-\\nrelated deaths and vector-borne diseases, such as malaria, dengue \\nfever, Zika, and Lyme disease; and unpredictable impacts on our \\neconomy and way of life. \\nBy the 2050s, New York City will be hotter than ever before. \\nAverage temperatures are expected to increase by up to 5.7 degrees \\nFahrenheit, and many more New Yorkers may die each summer \\nfrom intense heat than the 130 who die annually today. By the \\n2050s, the estimated average annual precipitation increase of up to \\n11 percent will pose significant risks to the entire city. The nearly 1 \\nmillion residents who will live in the expanded coastal floodplain \\nwill be particularly vulnerable to coastal flooding, with sea levels \\nexpected to rise by up to 30 inches.

Buildings, however, still represent roughly 70 \\npercent of the city’s GHG emissions profile; our buildings—old and \\nnew—will need to change dramatically in order to achieve carbon \\nneutrality. The City will expand our initiatives to support deep energy \\nretrofits in nearly every building in New York City, as well as require \\nnew buildings to eliminate their carbon emissions footprint. This \\nincludes buildings with inefficient glass facades. Existing glass-walled \\nbuildings will be required to dramatically improve performance, in \\nline with the City’s mandates, and we will not allow all-glass facades \\nin new construction, unless they meet strict new performance \\nguidelines. Together, these actions will make inefficient glass-heavy \\nbuilding designs a relic of the past. And to help ensure that every \\nbuilding in New York City is able to participate in the transition to \\ncarbon neutrality, we will increase technical assistance programs and \\nthe availability of financing.\\n• IMPLEMENT CITYWIDE ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND  \\nINTENSITY MANDATE  \\nIn 2017, the City recognized that voluntary action was not sufficient \\nand proposed mandatory energy use limits for existing buildings. \\nThe City is now working with City Council to implement legislative \\nrequirements to dramatically cut emissions in buildings over \\n25,000 square feet. We will then continue to protect affordability \\nwhile expanding the benefits of energy efficiency upgrades to all \\nbuildings including affordable housing units and buildings smaller \\nthan the previously mandated threshold. To ensure every building \\nhas flexibility to meet the mandates, the City will study and launch \\nan emissions trading regime.

To achieve \\na carbon neutral transportation system, we will need to reduce \\nour dependence on cars and ensure all transportation needs — \\nincluding, but not limited to, commuting and freight — shift \\nto more sustainable alternatives. We must reach an 80 percent \\nsustainable mode share — trips completed via walking, biking, \\nor transit — for commuting by 2050, and reduce or eliminate \\nemissions for the remaining trips through the widespread adoption \\nof alternative-fuel vehicles. This will require an expansion of electric \\ncharging networks for all types of vehicles, a reimagining of our \\nstreetscapes to encourage further shifts away from single-occupancy \\nvehicles, and working with major employers and institutions to \\nmanage transportation. Even the way goods move around the city \\nwill need to change: Zero or near-zero emission vehicles will serve \\nthe city’s freight needs, complementing the use of barges, rail, and \\nlast mile “micromobility” options such as cargo bicycles. \\nSee Efficient Mobility  and Modern Infrastructure for a \\ncomprehensive vision for a safer, more-accessible, and more-\\nsustainable citywide transportation system. Key commitments \\ninclude: \\n• DEVELOP A CITYWIDE NETWORK OF EV CHARGING \\nINFRASTRUCTURE  \\nIn order to encourage EV adoption, we will increase the number \\nof publicly available EV chargers across the five boroughs by \\ninstalling a network of fast charging stations on City-owned \\nproperty and piloting curbside Level 2 charging in partnership \\nwith Con Edison. \\n• REDUCE THE CITY’S MUNICIPAL FLEET AND LOWER \\nEMISSIONS \\nThe City is making smart reforms to our municipal fleet, \\ncapitalizing on emerging technology and transportation trends \\nto reduce the number and size of City vehicles and vehicle miles \\ntraveled, thereby reducing emissions, and by 2040, the City fleet \\nwill be carbon neutral. Near term emissions reductions will be \\nachieved by implementing renewable diesel fuel, accelerating \\nthe transition to EV and hybrid vehicles, and increasing the \\nefficiency of the fleet. Longer-term reductions will rely on \\nachieving a 100 percent clean electricity grid and encouraging \\ntechnological advances for emergency response and other heavy \\nvehicles. \\n• INCENTIVIZE COMMERCIAL AND FLEET VEHICLES TO \\nREDUCE EMISSIONS  \\nWe will explore dedicated curb space for zero-emission \\nvehicles, expand clean truck programs, and use advanced \\nsensing for vehicle air pollution. We will encourage operators \\nto upgrade their fleet vehicles to the most efficient models \\navailable. The City will also leverage funding allocated by \\nthe Volkswagen settlement to promote diesel-to-electric \\nreplacements of commercial vehicles. \\n• ESTABLISH COMMERCIAL WASTE ZONES  \\nCommercial waste zoning will reduce truck traffic associated \\nwith commercial waste collection by more than 50 percent, \\nwith corresponding air quality and GHG emissions \\nimprovements. It will also give the City additional tools to \\npromote zero waste, enforce existing laws, ensure safety and \\nworker rights, and advance the City’s efficient transportation \\ngoals, while creating high-quality, low-cost waste management \\nservices.

When our organic trash goes to landfill, it decomposes \\nand generates methane, a greenhouse gas roughly 30 times more \\npotent than carbon dioxide. The farther we have to transport our \\ntrash to landfills, the more emissions are generated. Conversely, \\nour carbon footprint will shrink if we reduce the amount of waste \\ngenerated by New Yorkers, and encourage sustainable products \\nthat can be more easily recycled at their end of life.\\nWhile New Yorkers produce less waste than ever before, a large \\npercentage of what we send to landfills could be diverted to \\nbeneficial use and support our climate mitigation goals. The \\nCity’s 2017 Waste Characterization Study shows that if every New \\nYorker recycled and composted perfectly, we could divert 68 \\npercent of our trash from landfills. Recycled paper, cardboard, \\nmetal, glass, and plastic are used in the manufacturing of new \\nproducts. Organic material, food scraps, and yard waste are \\nturned into compost — a natural soil amendment that improves \\nsoil health — and renewable energy (including electricity, heat, \\nand fuel) through anaerobic digestion.\\nThrough our Zero Waste initiatives, we have implemented the \\ncountry’s largest curbside organics program, providing organics \\ncollection to more than 3.5 million New Yorkers, or more than \\na third of the city. We have increased the citywide residential \\ndiversion rate to over 20 percent — and we are recycling more \\nthan ever. We are using the power of policy to hold product \\nmanufacturers accountable for sustainable design choices, \\nincluding a ban on foam products, which have widely available \\nrecyclable alternatives.\\n \\nDespite these successes, we continue to face local, regional, \\nand global challenges to our Zero Waste goals. Our population \\ncontinues to grow and produce more trash, even as our per \\ncapita waste generation goes down. Global recycling markets \\nare also experiencing a period of instability that has left some \\nmunicipalities with no other option than to send their recyclables \\nto landfills. In New York City, past investments in recycling \\ninfrastructure have allowed our program to remain strong; \\nhowever, we need to be creative and committed, and have the \\nparticipation of all New Yorkers, to reach our goal.\\n• TRANSITION TO MANDATORY ORGANICS COLLECTION CITYWIDE \\nThe City will pursue expanding the country’s largest organics \\nmanagement program, including curbside pickup, drop-off sites, \\nand support for community composting opportunities, by working \\nwith the City Council to establish mandatory organics recycling \\ncitywide — phasing in starting in low- and medium-density areas \\nthat already have access to organics collection and expanding \\nover time to include the entire city — so that all New Yorkers can \\nparticipate. We will also increase the diversion of organics from \\ncommercial establishments. Organics will continue to be used for \\ncompost and energy production.\\n• DEVELOP REGIONAL ORGANICS PROCESSING CAPACITY TO \\nHANDLE 1 MILLION TONS OF FOOD AND YARD WASTE PER YEAR \\nWe will increase our capacity to process organics both inside \\nand outside the city, working with our agencies and private-\\nsector partners to process organics for beneficial use. Some \\norganic wastes can be processed into renewable natural gas \\nusing digesters, whereas others can continue to be turned \\ninto soil amendments or compost for use in our parks, green \\ninfrastructure, landscaping, street trees, gardens, and farms.\\n• REACH ZERO WASTE ACROSS NEW YORK CITY GOVERNMENT \\nOPERATIONS \\nThe City will lead by example and implement sustainable waste \\nmanagement strategies and operations in City buildings, facilities, \\nand programs. We will add organics collection service at all \\nagencies, design buildings for zero waste in all new construction, \\nleverage procurement requirements to minimize the purchase \\nof non-divertible goods, maximize capture rates of recyclables at \\nCity agencies, and beneficially use our biosolids. \\n• MAXIMIZE THE DIVERSION OF TRADITIONAL RECYCLABLES, \\nTEXTILES, AND OTHER PRODUCTS  \\nNew Yorkers throw away about half of their recyclables — and \\n10 percent of the waste stream consists of textiles and other \\nproducts that could be diverted to beneficial use. For example, \\nwe throw away nearly 200,000 tons of textile waste citywide per \\nyear, at great cost to both taxpayers and our environment. We will \\nprovide universal access to programs to divert these materials and \\nmotivate New Yorkers through education and outreach. We will \\nalso pursue increased compliance through  expanded enforcement. \\nAt the same time, we will strengthen demand for these recyclable \\nitems by working with manufacturers to use recycled content in \\nnew products. We will also expand the use of extended producer-\\nresponsibility measures to keep more products out of our landfills \\nand continue to reduce the amount of non-recyclable products in \\nour waste stream. We will work with our City and State partners to \\nimplement a ban on single-use plastic bags and a fee on paper bags.\\n• TRANSITION NEW YORK CITY TOWARD A CIRCULAR ECONOMY\\nNew York City will become a center of excellence for sustainable \\nproduct design by partnering with the private sector to design \\nand market products that are reusable, repairable, or recyclable. \\nWe will create incentives and infrastructure for city businesses \\nand consumers to use recycled materials to support the growth \\nof closed-loop recycling. Through the power of policy, advocacy, \\nprocurement, and regulation, we will take a leadership role \\nin driving brands and product manufacturers to design for \\nreturnability, reusability, repairability, recyclability, and \\ncompostability.

Through \\nupdates to our Environmentally Preferable Purchasing (EPP) and \\nexecutive action, we are ending the purchasing of unnecessary \\nsingle-use plastic foodware, reducing the purchasing of beef, and \\nphasing out the purchasing of processed meat.  \\n \\nSingle-use plastic foodware — including straws, cutlery, cups, \\nplates, bowls, and trays — are designed to be used once and then \\nthrown away. These petroleum-based products are a threat to our \\nneighborhoods, waterways, and climate. The City is ending the \\npurchasing of unnecessary single-use plastic foodware, switching \\nto compostable, reusable, or recyclable alternatives while \\nmaintaining a sufficient supply of single-use plastic foodware for \\nthose who need it. And we will work with City Council to expand \\nthese requirements to private businesses.  \\n \\nBuilding on the success of implementing Meatless Mondays at all \\nNew York City public schools, the City will reduce the purchasing \\nof beef by 50 percent. Beef has a relatively high environmental \\nfootprint compared to poultry, pork, and plant-based foods. Beef \\ncattle, managing manure, and manufacturing fertilizer produces \\nnitrous oxide and methane, two climate-warming pollutants 298 \\nand 25 times more powerful than carbon dioxide, respectively. \\nProcessed meat consumption is linked with increased risk of \\ncancer and is often high in saturated fat and sodium which is \\nlinked with heart disease. This policy would offer health benefits \\nto the most vulnerable New Yorkers.  \\n• EXPAND OPPORTUNITIES FOR CLIMATE AND SUSTAINABILITY \\nLITERACY FOR EDUCATORS AND STUDENTS \\nThe City will support local programs, organizations, and our \\nagencies to expand climate and sustainability education resources \\nin schools, including professional learning and curriculum \\ndevelopment or alignment.

In \\nparticular, many were concerned about the reliability \\nand efficiency of the MTA subway system, along with \\nthe need to improve the speed and frequency of bus \\nroutes, support mass transit, and reduce congestion. \\nOthers cited the need to make our streets safer and \\ntransportation more accessible. One respondent \\nrecommended “limiting free parking, encouraging \\ncycling, and making driving more expensive.” Another \\nsuggested, “The subway and bus system should be \\nupdated with a tap system, permanent cards, and a \\nmobile pay app.” \\nIn addition, during a February 2019 discussion with \\nmore than 50 New York City small business owners, we \\nheard a need for new strategies to reduce congestion \\nand better manage curb space given the competing \\ndemand from private vehicles, delivery companies, for-\\nhire vehicles, cyclists, pedestrians, and buses, including \\nthrough technology and new regulations that create \\npriority zones.\\nNYC.GOV/ OneNYC\\nTechnology and new transportation options are transforming \\nhow we get around the city, and will continue to do so. While \\nautonomous vehicle technology is still nascent, its potential \\nfuture deployment could have impacts on the city. We must \\nensure that it serves residents equitably, helps achieve Vision \\nZero goals, and accounts for its impacts to communities, workers, \\nand infrastructure. Already, app-based for-hire vehicles (FHVs) \\nhave attracted significant numbers of riders away from subways \\nand buses. They have also contributed to increased congestion, \\nespecially in Manhattan below 60th Street, where travel speeds \\nhave fallen by more than 20 percent since 2010. \\nSlowed by congestion, buses have seen ridership decrease to \\nbelow 2010 levels. Between 2016 and 2017, annual bus ridership \\ndecreased by almost 40 million rides, while for-hire car trips \\nincreased by nearly 40 million. The City has worked with the \\nMTA to improve bus service on the busiest routes, doubling the \\npace of Select Bus Service routes since 2015. But given these \\nchallenging underlying conditions on the streets, the City must \\ncontinue to expand and improve bus service.\\nWith New York City’s population projected to exceed 9 million \\nby 2050, and with capacity already stretched thin on congested \\nroads and subways, we must prioritize and invest in efficient and \\nsustainable transportation modes: biking, walking, and mass \\ntransit.  By doing so, we will be able to reduce greenhouse gas \\n(GHG) emissions, support sustainable growth, and achieve the \\nambitious goal we set in 2015 to have 80 percent of all trips in the \\ncity taken by sustainable modes by 2050. The city will prioritize \\nsustainable modes in the planning and design of the built \\nenvironment, and help make them the default choice in New York \\nCity so no one needs to rely on a car.\\nPEDESTRIANS, BUS USERS, SUBWAY RIDERS, AND A BICYCLIST IN MORNINGSIDE \\nHEIGHTS, MANHATTAN.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 15.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 14.0 (Windows)', 'creationdate': '2019-04-30T13:48:30-04:00', 'moddate': '2020-01-03T15:55:12-05:00', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'OneNYC_2050_Strategic_Plan.pdf', 'total_pages': 332, 'page': 271, 'page_label': '272'}, page_content='8   |   O neNYC 2050 : EFFICIENT MOBILITY\\nNYC.GOV/ OneNYC\\n120K\\n100K\\n80K\\n60K\\n40K\\n20K\\n0K\\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\\nYELLOW TAXIS\\nGREEN TAXIS\\nAPP-BASED FHV  \\n(UBER, LYFT,\\nJUNO, ETC.)\\nBLACK CAR / \\nLIVERY\\nThe number of app-based FHVs licensed by TLC has increased \\ndramatically since their introduction in 2012.  \\n \\nTAXIS AND FOR-HIRE VEHICLES LICENSED BY NEW YORK CITY\\nSources: TLC \\nApp-Based FHVs are those affiliated with TLC-licensed bases owned by four largest companies by trip volume.\\nPROGRESS \\n \\nWE HAVE MADE PROGRESS OVER THE PAST YEARS TO \\nIMPROVE THE CITY’S TRANSPORTATION NETWORK.

As cities such as London, Stockholm and Singapore \\nhave shown, congestion pricing can substantially reduce traffic, \\nnoxious emissions, and improve quality of life. Recommendations \\nfor New York City’s congestion pricing program will be made by \\nthe Traffic Mobility Review Board to the MTA at the end of 2020.  \\nThe board will consider managing demand through variable \\npricing and will consider many factors including, but not limited \\nto, safety, hardships, vehicle types and environmental impact. As \\nrevenue from congestion pricing helps ensure transit reliability, \\nridership will grow and attract people who may be currently be \\nusing FHVs or personal vehicles.  \\n• LEVERAGE NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO ENFORCE TRAFFIC LAWS \\nCongestion can be addressed not only by managing vehicle \\ndemand in core business districts, but also by enhancing existing \\ntraffic law enforcement via new technologies and innovative \\napproaches. In particular, NYPD will work with DOT to deploy \\nhandheld license plate readers and a license plate-based system \\nfor parking administration and enforcement to create a culture of \\ncompliance with traffic laws, increase parking-space turnover, and \\nreduce vehicle circling and double-parking.  \\n \\nSimilarly, DOT will research, and pending state legislation, pilot \\nsensor and camera-based enforcement of double parking, “block \\nthe box” solutions, commercial vehicle violations, overweight and \\nover-dimensional rules, truck routes and other parking rules. \\nThese initiatives are likely to reduce congestion and air pollution, \\naccelerate progress on GHG emissions goals, and support Vision \\nZero safety initiatives. \\n \\nAutomated enforcement devices deter problem behaviors as \\ndrivers quickly come to realize they will likely be penalized.  \\nAs a result of speed camera enforcement, speeding is down  \\nby over 60 percent at fixed-camera locations, and red-light \\nviolations have fallen 75 percent at active locations. Thanks  \\nto leadership from the State legislature, the number of school \\nspeed camera zones will increase from 140 to 750, and the \\nhours and locations of operation will be extended. The City will \\nadvocate for State legislation for automated enforcement of select \\nroad laws, including automatically assessing parking fines and \\nlane violations. \\n• CONTINUE RECENT CONGESTION ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS  \\nNew technologies will supplement recent congestion-fighting \\nenforcement efforts which have included increased NYPD \\nfocus on block-the-box, streamlined curbside regulation \\nto allow moving lanes during peak hours, and improved \\nenforcement of HOV lanes. \\n• OPTIMIZE CURB USE  \\nThe City will optimize the use of curbside space by expanding \\nbus and bike lanes, commercial loading/unloading, safety \\ndesigns, and other high value uses of the curb. An effective \\ncurbside management system supports the City’s economic \\ndevelopment, social equity, and environmental sustainability \\ngoals. Working with communities and other agencies, DOT \\nwill enhance neighborhood safety, desirability, and accessibility \\nto support commerce, create strong vibrant communities, and \\nreduce the harmful impacts of vehicles on the environment. \\n \\nDOT will launch a Parking Improvement Program focused on \\nexisting commercial districts across the city to reduce double-\\nparking, improve the overall efficiency of the roadways, and \\nexpand commercial loading/unloading zones. This builds on \\nDOT’s existing Street Improvement Program, which improves \\npedestrian safety and adds bus and bike lanes as well as plazas \\nand other street amenities where appropriate. DOT is also \\npartnering with the Department of Sanitation to evaluate the \\npotential for innovative solutions to curbside collection and \\nstorage of waste to reduce sidewalk clutter, increase collection \\nefficiency, and improve quality of life.

This will \\neliminate 1,000 public vehicles and ten million annual vehicle \\nmiles traveled from the roads, thereby helping to reduce traffic \\nand demand for parking from public vehicles.\\n• GREEN THE FLEET  \\nThe City fleet will aim to become carbon neutral by 2040. Near \\nterm emissions reductions will be achieved by implementing \\nrenewable diesel fuel, accelerating the transition to EV and \\nhybrid vehicles, and increasing the efficiency of the fleet, \\nwhich will help reduce the City’s fuel consumption to below \\n2014 levels. Longer term reductions will rely on the 100 \\npercent clean electricity grid planned by New York State and \\nencouraging technological advances for emergency response \\nand heavy vehicles.\\nINCENTIVIZE COMMERCIAL AND FLEET \\nVEHICLES TO REDUCE EMISSIONS \\n \\nIn select locations, the City, through DOT, will work with MOS, \\nthe NYPD, DMV, and the freight industry to pilot Green Loading \\nZones, which dedicate curb space for zero-emission vehicles \\n(ZEVs) to pick up and drop off goods. If successful, the pilot might \\nlead to a phased expansion of low-emission areas where ZEVs \\nand freight e-cycles would have dedicated curb access, non-ZEV \\nlow-emission vehicles might have priority access by permit, and \\nhigher-polluting trucks might have more restricted opportunities \\nfor loading and unloading, including restrictions of rush hour \\ndeliveries.

Additionally, \\nmillions of tons of freight are moved into, out of, and through \\nthe city to service the region’s economy and residents. As the \\nregion grows, increasing access to opportunity and decreasing \\nroadway congestion requires a regional approach and coordinated \\nsolutions. We will improve our connections to the region to \\nbetter serve New York City residents, businesses and visitors, \\nmodernize the city’s freight network by reducing reliance on \\ntrucks, encouraging sustainable rail and maritime freight \\nalternatives, and improving \"last mile\" deliveries, and support \\nimproved operations and access to our airports.  \\nEXPAND REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION \\nCONNECTIVITY AND CAPACITY \\n \\nMany New Yorkers think of regional rail as being for commuters \\nfrom outside the city. Yet with 39 commuter rail stations within \\nthe five boroughs, this system has the potential to be better \\nutilized within the city while improving connections to the \\nregion. Through regional fare integration, the city can follow the \\nexamples set by London, Paris, and Tokyo, which have integrated \\nrapid and commuter transit to amplify their mobility options. \\nWith an anticipated 40 percent increase in commuters from New \\nJersey by 2040, and growth in other neighboring areas, we must \\nexpand capacity to support the regional economy, and evaluate \\nintroducing through-running of commuter rail to better connect \\nthe region and ease congestion at transit hubs. \\n• INVEST IN MAJOR TRANS-HUDSON IMPROVEMENTS  \\nThe Gateway Program is one of the most important transit \\nprojects in the nation, and is critical to the future of New \\nYork City and the metropolitan region. The first phase of the \\nprogram will construct new tunnels across the Hudson River \\nto increase capacity and redundancy, which will allow for the \\nproper rehabilitation of the existing 110 year-old tunnels that \\nwere seriously damaged by Hurricane Sandy. Federal funding \\nis urgently needed. If the existing tunnels were to shut down \\nit would cost the region billions of dollars and impact the \\ncommutes of nearly half a million people. \\n \\nThe Port Authority Bus Terminal (PABT) in Midtown is \\ncurrently over capacity and in poor physical condition and \\nwill need to be rebuilt in order to accommodate the growing \\nnumber of people coming by bus to Midtown, including \\nthose that have had to resort to street loading with no space \\navailable inside the current facility. The rebuilding of the PABT \\nmust address the need for creating space for intercity as well \\nas commuter buses, manage air-quality impacts, integrate \\nseamlessly with other modes of transportation, and deliver a \\ndesign befitting its stature as gateway to a global city.\\n• COMPLETE PENN STATION AND EAST SIDE ACCESS \\nPROJECTS \\nThe Long Island Railroad (LIRR) East Side Access project, to be \\ncompleted by 2022, and the forthcoming Metro North Railroad \\n(MNR) Penn Station Access project offer a vision of more \\nintegrated and connected commuter rail systems that can add \\nredundancy and increase capacity to serve the growing region. \\nEast Side Access will allow more than 150,000 daily commuters \\na direct connection to the East Side of Midtown, providing a \\nfaster and easier commute to Long Island and Queens residents. \\nThe Penn Station Access project will provide a one-seat ride \\nfor the New Haven Metro-North line into Penn Station, while \\nadding four new ADA-accessible stations to the East Bronx. \\nThis will dramatically reduce travel times for commuters, while \\nbringing reliable transit to underserved communities.\\nINITIATIVE 27 OF 30 \\n \\nSTRENGTHEN CONNECTIONS TO THE \\nREGION AND THE WORLD'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 15.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 14.0 (Windows)', 'creationdate': '2019-04-30T13:48:30-04:00', 'moddate': '2020-01-03T15:55:12-05:00', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'OneNYC_2050_Strategic_Plan.pdf', 'total_pages': 332, 'page': 292, 'page_label': '293'}, page_content='29   |   O neNYC 2050 : EFFICIENT MOBILITY\\nNYC.GOV/O neNYC\\n• EVALUATE THROUGH-RUNNING OF COMMUTER RAIL \\nSERVICE \\nCommuter rail service that connects New Jersey Transit \\n(NJT) and MTA commuter rail service—known as “through-\\nrunning”—would provide advantages in passenger mobility, as \\nwell as operational benefits at congested Penn Station. MTA \\nimplemented a limited trial of this service for the 2014 Super \\nBowl, and has committed to further evaluating its potential \\ngoing forward. The City supports operational improvements that \\nmight limit future costs of capacity expansion at Penn Station, \\nand increase opportunities for service to secondary centers on the \\nNortheast Corridor  — especially Long Island City and the Bronx. \\nIn addition, the introduction of new fare-payment mechanisms \\nand technology allow for trip and fare integration between \\nsystems even where physical transfers are necessary.\\n• ADVOCATE FOR REGIONAL FARE INTEGRATION WITH \\nCOMMUTER RAIL LINES, FERRIES, AND OTHER MODES  \\nWhile performance and capacity issues pose challenges for \\nthe New York City Transit (NYCT) system, the LIRR and \\nMNR commuter rail systems remain underutilized by in-city \\ncommuters, in large part because of high fares and the lack \\nof a free transfer to the subway and bus network. However, \\ncommuter rail could dramatically shorten the commutes of \\nmany city residents living far from subway lines. The MTA \\nshould reduce the fare of in-city commuter rail trips to the \\nsame fare as NYCT subway and buses with free transfers \\nbetween these systems. Lower daily, weekly and monthly fares \\nfor in-City trips with free subway/bus transfers would divert \\ntens of thousands of daily riders from crowded subway lines \\nand dramatically reduce vehicle trips. The MTA’s rollout of its \\nOne Metro New York (OMNY) contactless payment system \\noffers the mechanism for regional fare integration, and the \\nCity will work with MTA to support the integration of more \\nmodes of transportation, including NYC Ferry, into the system. \\n• COORDINATE WITH NEIGHBORING AREAS TO IMPROVE \\nCROSS-BORDER TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS  \\nMore than 300,000 New York City residents work outside \\nthe city, with many commuting between the Bronx and \\nWestchester, or Queens and Long Island. These reverse \\ncommuters experience inadequate rail and infrequent bus \\nservices, in addition to poorly planned interchanges between \\nsuburban modes and the subway. New York City will work \\nmore closely with suburban neighbors to support these critical \\nreverse-commute links, and expanding last-mile transit access. \\nMODERNIZE NEW YORK CITY’S FREIGHT \\nTRANSPORTATION NETWORK\\n \\nIn 2017, truck-traffic congestion cost the local economy $862 \\nmillion, hurting local businesses and increasing vehicle emissions \\nfrom idling. Local freight volumes are forecasted to grow an \\nestimated 68 percent by 2045, which would only exacerbate \\nalready worsening highway congestion and air quality. Provided \\nthat trucks move roughly 90 percent of freight by volume through \\nthe City, multimodal solutions are necessary to mitigate these \\nimpacts. \\n \\nGiven rising local freight volumes, and 41 percent of New Yorkers \\nreceiving a delivery at their home more than once a week, \\nthe City must work to reduce the impacts of trucks that deliver \\nlast-mile freight. This can be accomplished through the use of \\nalternative fuels, clean technologies, off-hour deliveries, mobile \\napplications, and facilitating the delivery of construction-related \\ncargo by water.  \\nCRANES UNLOAD FREIGHT AT RED HOOK CONTAINER TERMINAL IN BROOKLYN.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 15.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 14.0 (Windows)', 'creationdate': '2019-04-30T13:48:30-04:00', 'moddate': '2020-01-03T15:55:12-05:00', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'OneNYC_2050_Strategic_Plan.pdf', 'total_pages': 332, 'page': 293, 'page_label': '294'}, page_content='1\\n1\\n3\\n7\\n5\\n6\\n2\\n4\\n2\\n3 7\\n10\\n6\\n4\\n9\\n8\\n5 2\\n3\\n1\\nNYC.GOV/ OneNYC30   |   O neNYC 2050 : EFFICIENT MOBILITY\\n• IMPLEMENT FREIGHT NYC  \\nReleased in July 2018, Freight NYC is the City’s action \\nplan to overhaul the aging freight-distribution system. \\nThrough strategic investments, the New York City Economic \\nDevelopment Corporation (NYCEDC) seeks to modernize rail \\nand maritime infrastructure, develop modern distribution \\nfacilities, and incentivize the deployment of clean trucks—all \\nwhile creating nearly 5,000 good-paying jobs for New Yorkers. \\nThrough Freight NYC, the City and its partners are acting to \\nprotect the environment, traffic systems, and regional economy \\nin the decades to come.  \\n \\nFreight NYC includes plans to develop a barge terminal to \\nserve the Hunts Point Food Distribution Center, coordinate \\nwith regional partners on increasing marine freight, construct \\nnew transload facilities and rail sidings to connect Brooklyn \\nand Queens to the national rail network, and support the \\ndevelopment of freight hubs across the city to optimize the \\ndistribution network and reduce miles traveled.

Key strategies include incentivizing sustainable last \\nmile freight delivery by pedal-assist bicycles and electric \\nvehicles, exploring opportunities for microfreight distribution \\ncenters in highly congested commercial areas, promoting the \\ndevelopment of delivery and service plans for large freight \\ngenerators, and expanding the Off-Hour Deliveries Program \\nto 900 new retail locations by the end of 2021. Shifting \\ndeliveries to off-hours can reduce delivery costs, reduce fuel \\nconsumption, improve air quality, and reduce congestion. \\nThe City estimates that if only 10 percent of freight receivers \\nin Manhattan participate in the program, congestion during \\nbusiness hours can be reduced by approximately 6 percent. In \\naddition to encouraging off-hour deliveries, the City will revise \\nrules to cut double parking, use its role on the Traffic Mobility \\nReview Board to reduce peak hour truck deliveries through \\npricing, and refine enforcement and restrictions on delivery \\ntimes rules in key congested areas, while mindful of effects on \\nlocal businesses.\\nIMPROVE THE SUSTAINABILITY AND \\nEFFICIENCY OF AIR TRAVEL\\n \\nNew York City is a global point of entry and destination \\nfor tourists, business people, and immigrants. Our region’s \\nairports are gateways to the world, serving more than 130 \\nmillion passengers a year. The Port Authority of NY & NJ \\n(PANYNJ), which manages the airports, has committed to major \\nrevitalization projects for passenger terminal infrastructure \\nat John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK), LaGuardia \\nAirport (LGA), and Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR). \\nThese enhancements will significantly improve the passenger \\nexperience.\\n \\nHowever, despite substantial ongoing investments, airport \\ncapacity is nearly maxed out, limited by congested airspace \\nand a finite number of runways. Furthermore, an outdated slot \\nmanagement system at JFK and LGA limits airline competition  \\nwhile providing perverse incentives. Finally, our region relies on \\nan outdated, overburdened, and understaffed National Airspace \\nSystem that hampers airport capacity. By some estimates, \\nrippling delays from our region cause up to 60 percent of all \\nnationwide delays in air travel.  \\n  \\nAs the landlord of the PANYNJ, the City should ensure airport \\noperations meet the needs of a global city. This means expanding \\ncapacity and increasing competition to ensure affordable travel \\nfor all, while working with the airlines and other stakeholders to \\nreduce noise and GHG emissions.\\n• ENCOURAGE SUSTAINABLE ALTERNATIVES FOR AVIATION \\nFUEL AND ELECTRIFY AIRPORT EQUIPMENT  \\nAir travel is the most difficult transportation mode to \\ndecarbonize because aircraft require liquid fuels. Electrification \\nfor aircraft is not yet realistic option at scale, and development \\ntimelines for new aircraft span decades, so many of the \\naircraft in use today will still be in use in the 2030s and 2040s. \\nSustainable aviation fuels can help reduce the GHG footprint of \\nthe aviation sector as other sectors electrify. Sustainable aviation \\nfuel can reduce the life cycle of GHG emissions by up to 80 \\npercent. \\n  \\nTechnology currently exists to electrify most of the equipment \\nused to service aircraft, including baggage tugs, pushback \\ntractors, and belt loaders. Electrifying this equipment \\ncould substantially reduce GHG emissions and result in \\ndisproportionate benefits to air quality. As part of the airline \\nlease agreements, the City recommends a phase out of the \\noldest and dirtiest equipment and a move to electrified \\nequipment by 2025. Similarly, ground transportation providers \\nsuch as taxis, livery cabs, and shuttle-bus operators all have \\nsubstantial options for vehicle electrification.\\n• ADVOCATE FOR ACCELERATED ROLLOUT OF NEXTGEN \\nPROGRAM AND OPERATIONAL IMPROVEMENTS AT \\nREGIONAL AIRPORTS  \\nFor more than ten years, the Federal Aviation Administration \\n(FAA) has been introducing elements of an ambitious program, \\nNextGen, to reform the National Airspace System. The full \\nrollout of NextGen across the region will reduce aircraft delays \\nboth in the air and on the ground. However, with inconsistent \\nfederal funding and only gradual adoption by airlines, rollout \\nhas been slower than anticipated. Accelerated investment in \\nNextGen aircraft equipment will be needed to realize the full \\ndelay-reduction benefits. NextGen implementation should be \\ncoupled with a reasonable review of operating limitations, or \\nslots, allocated at JFK and LGA to ensure takeoff and landing \\ncapacity is as efficient as possible. \\n \\nAdditionally, there are short-term fixes that can help reduce \\nregional delays. Fully staffing FAA facilities would improve \\nutilization of existing runways and airspace. Additionally, \\nthe Port Authority should continue to ensure runway \\nrehabilitations and terminal redesigns include associated \\nimprovements to taxiways and airfield infrastructure, which \\ncan be a low-cost way to improve the configuration of its \\nairfields and use real estate more efficiently.\\n• SUPPORT IMPROVED TRANSIT ACCESS TO  \\nJFK, LGA, AND EWR \\nMost global cities have fast and direct mass transit access \\nto their major airports, and New York City should be no \\nexception.

Yet the delivery of essential services depends on \\ninfrastructure that is currently in need of significant r epair, \\ninvestment, and modern asset management. \\nMuch of the city’s infrastructure was built a century ago and \\nhas suffered from historic disinvestment, neglect, and poor \\nmaintenance. On average, our sewer mains are 85 years old, water \\nmains are 70 years old, and the electric grid dates back to the \\n1920s. Transportation infrastructure suffers from performance \\nand capacity issues, with a subway system suffering from \\nunreliable service and overcrowding, and significant funding \\ngaps for the Gateway Program — which will replace critical \\ntrans-Hudson tunnels damaged by Hurricane Sandy. The Port \\nAuthority Bus Terminal in Midtown — a major transportation \\ngateway to the city — was built in 1950, and despite renovations \\nover the years, is over capacity and has physically degraded. To \\nmeet the needs of a growing population and economy, and to \\nprepare for a changing climate, we must fortify and upgrade our \\ninfrastructure.  \\nConstruction activity is at a record level across the city, \\ncontributing to rising construction and materials costs. \\nMeanwhile there is insufficient urban infrastructure spending \\nat the federal level. State and local regulations add substantial \\nburdens to capital project delivery, inflating costs and timelines, \\nand legacy technology systems impair the City’s ability to analyze, \\ntrack, and ensure accountability on its projects. Therefore, it is \\nmore important than ever to identify and resolve inefficiencies in \\nthe City’s delivery of capital infrastructure projects.\\nTo keep pace with a growing population and economy, our \\ncore infrastructure must be adapted for the 21 st century, \\nespecially in terms of digital infrastructure — to make it easier \\nand more affordable for all residents and small businesses to \\ngain broadband coverage, be digitally literate and aware of \\ncyberthreats and misinformation, and make New York City \\na global leader in smart cities cybersecurity. The City’s 2015 \\ncommitment to universal broadband relied on cooperation from \\nthe federal government to require higher quality and affordability \\nstandards from the private sector. Since 2017, the federal \\ngovernment has undercut our policy gains, undermined local \\nauthority over public property, and eliminated net neutrality \\nprotections, leaving the City alone in striving to ensure more \\nbroadband options are available to all New Yorkers. These \\nchallenges, however, will not stand in our way.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 15.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 14.0 (Windows)', 'creationdate': '2019-04-30T13:48:30-04:00', 'moddate': '2020-01-03T15:55:12-05:00', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'OneNYC_2050_Strategic_Plan.pdf', 'total_pages': 332, 'page': 306, 'page_label': '307'}, page_content='7   |   O neNYC 2050 : MODERN INFRASTRUCTURE\\nNYC.GOV/O neNYC\\nWHAT WE HEARD  \\nFROM NEW YORKERS\\nOF THE MORE THAN 14,000 RESPONDENTS TO \\nOUR CITYWIDE SURVEY, 57 PERCENT SELECTED \\nTRANSPORTATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE AS A \\nCHALLENGE FACING THE CITY. The most frequently \\ncited theme was a need for more investment in citywide \\ninfrastructure to support the increasing population, \\nas well as a push for new innovative funding streams \\nto support this goal. Respondents also emphasized the \\nimportance of updating the city’s digital infrastructure \\n— for example, by increasing connectivity and \\ncybersecurity — to meet modern demands. As one \\nperson recommended, “Provide better internet security \\nmeasures that will prevent scams and hackers on mobile \\nand personal computers.”  \\nPROGRESS\\nAS PART OF THE CITY’S MORE THAN $100 BILLION TEN-\\nYEAR CAPITAL STRATEGY, THE CITY HAS MADE STRATEGIC \\nIMPROVEMENTS TO KEY INFRASTRUCTURE NETWORKS.  \\nFor example, in 2015, to address long-standing concerns about \\nflooding in Southeast Queens, the City will invest $1.9 billion \\nover ten years for a robust, area-wide drainage system, and to \\nreplace old water mains — including 45 separate capital projects \\nin St. Albans, Rosedale, Jamaica, Laurelton, and Springfield \\nGardens. With the opening of the East 91st Street Marine \\nTransfer Station, the City has completed the last of the nine \\nfacilities envisioned in the long-term Solid Waste Management \\nPlan. NYC Ferry, launched in 2017, has become a popular and \\nwidely used addition to the City’s transportation network, with \\nride prices equal to those of the subway. \\nIn 2019, the Department of Design and Construction (DDC) \\nreleased A Strategic Blueprint for Construction Excellence , which \\nstrives to improve the agency’s capital project delivery, and \\nprovides a model the rest of the City can follow. In 2016, the \\ncreation of the Front End Planning units, which work with \\nclient agencies on project scopes, schedules, cost estimates, and \\nrisk assessments before the formal commencement of projects \\nhas ensured the scope of work and budget meet necessary \\nrequirements, thereby reducing project delays and cost overruns.\\nNew York City has also taken action to counter growing \\nvulnerability from cyberattacks, creating the New York City \\nCyber Command (NYC3) in 2017 . NYC3 has developed a \\ncoordinated approach to mitigating cyber risk, pioneering world-\\nclass approaches to preventing, detecting, responding to, and \\nrecovering from cyberthreats. \\n \\n“Provide better internet \\nsecurity measures that  \\nwill prevent scams and  \\nhackers on mobile and  \\npersonal computers.” \\n - Resident of Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn\\nConstruction activity is at a record level across \\nthe city, with permits increasing 44 percent \\nsince 2014, which contributes to rising con-\\nstruction and materials costs.\\nSource: DOB\\n200K\\n150K\\n100K\\n50K\\n0\\n2000\\n2001\\n2002\\n2003\\n2004\\n2005\\n2006\\nCONSTRUCTION PERMITS\\n2007\\n2008\\n2009\\n2010\\n2011\\n2012\\n2013\\n2014\\n2015\\n2016\\n2017\\n2018'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 15.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 14.0 (Windows)', 'creationdate': '2019-04-30T13:48:30-04:00', 'moddate': '2020-01-03T15:55:12-05:00', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'OneNYC_2050_Strategic_Plan.pdf', 'total_pages': 332, 'page': 307, 'page_label': '308'}, page_content='8   |   O neNYC 2050 : MODERN INFRASTRUCTURE\\nNYC.GOV/O neNYC\\nWHAT WE WILL DO \\nMODERNIZING OUR INFRASTRUCTURE REQUIRES A \\nCOMMITMENT TO DATA-DRIVEN CAPITAL PLANNING that \\nanticipates the needs of the future, while improving the capital \\ndelivery process to deliver more projects on time and on budget. A \\nmodern city requires smart infrastructure that includes high-\\nspeed broadband and is able to properly mobilize and respond to \\nany risk, whether it be cyberattacks, financial risks, or infectious \\ndisease.\\nThe City will continue to improve its capital planning practices \\nto direct resources and build out infrastructure, using population \\nprojections and the development pipeline, in addition to considering \\ndemographic shifts, the impacts from climate change, equity \\nimprovements, and community perspectives. In addition, significant \\nfunding has demonstrated the City’s continued dedication to \\nachieving a state of good repair. Emerging sensor technology, along \\nwith supporting data infrastructure, enables data-driven asset \\nmanagement, allowing the City to be proactive rather than reactive \\nto problems as they arise. To accelerate the pace of infrastructure \\nprojects, the City will reform capital planning processes to ensure \\nprojects are fully funded and delivered on time and on budget. \\nMeanwhile, the continuous upgrading of legacy technology systems \\noffers the possibility for greater data integration, analysis, and \\nperformance management. Furthermore, the State has already \\nbegun implementing best practices in capital delivery such as design-\\nbuild, for its own projects, and the City will continue advocating for \\nexpanded authority to do the same. \\nTo put New York City on the path to universal broadband, we will \\nincentivize new providers in more parts of the city, with options \\nfor faster service and respect for personal privacy. We will, through \\ndigital literacy programs, ensure residents are able to take full \\nadvantage of available broadband access, and create the world’s most \\nrobust cyber ecosystem.

These community perspectives are  therefore \\nconsidered in the planning process. As New York City strives to \\nbecome the fairest big city in the nation, we are committed to \\nevaluating and addressing historical inequities in investment \\nacross neighborhoods. \\nPLAN FOR CAPITAL INVESTMENTS \\nHOLISTICALLY AND COLLABORATIVELY\\n \\nCapital planning is an integral part of the City’s delivery of \\nservices to residents, ensuring infrastructure meets the needs of \\nboth today and the future. With the population increasing across \\nthe five boroughs, City agencies must use up-to-date, localized \\npopulation projections  to better understand where development \\nwill occur in order to better plan for infrastructure needs. For \\nexample, new housing development will lead to future school-\\nseat demand, which the School Construction Authority (SCA) \\nmust take into account in order to build out necessary capacity. \\nThis insight informed new funding needs that were included in \\nthe Preliminary Ten Year Capital Strategy and SCA ’s FY20–24 \\nCapital Plan , which will deliver 57,000 new school seats. City \\nagencies must continue to work collaboratively, using triple-\\nbottom-line criteria  to maximize economic, environmental, and \\nsocial benefits of capital investments, facilitate holistic planning, \\nand work together with utilities to plan and deliver modern \\ninfrastructure projects that meet the needs of all New Yorkers .\\n• EXPAND USE OF TRIPLE-BOTTOM-LINE PLANNING WITH A \\nFOCUS ON INTERAGENCY COLLABORATION  \\nSince 2015, City agencies have continued to adopt triple-\\nbottom-line principles that aim to maximize the economic, \\nenvironmental, and social benefits of capital investments. \\nThe Department of Transportation (DOT) uses these criteria \\nin a way that provides a model for all City agencies. DOT \\nprioritizes its street reconstruction projects by assessing their \\nanticipated contribution to each of the agency’s strategic goals. \\nProjects that improve safety and advance Vision Zero receive \\ngreater emphasis, although mobility, livability, environmental \\nsustainability, state of good repair, resiliency, equity, and \\ngrowth are also considered. DOT applies this standard \\nassessment to hundreds of proposed projects each year, and \\nprioritizes those that score highest.  \\n \\nRecently, DOT and the Department of Environmental \\nProtection (DEP) collaborated to prioritize projects that \\nfulfill the strategic plans of both agencies. With facilitation \\nfrom DDC’s Infrastructure Front End Planning Unit, DOT’s \\nprioritization schema considered input from DEP, which was \\nable to indicate which proposed DOT projects overlapped with \\nwater and sewer assets that should be replaced. By adding \\nscope to DOT projects before they are funded, the City can \\nadvance its comprehensive, strategic goals and improve capital \\nproject delivery through more accurate project scoping.  \\n \\nThe City, through DOT is also developing a standardized \\ntriple-bottom-line or benefit-cost framework to help \\nprioritize the most cost-effective projects. This framework \\nwill weigh each project’s costs against estimates of the social, \\nenvironmental, and economic benefits it would provide. DOT’s \\nroutine use of benefit-cost analysis is already driving a more \\nrigorous evaluation of projects against City and agency goals.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 15.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 14.0 (Windows)', 'creationdate': '2019-04-30T13:48:30-04:00', 'moddate': '2020-01-03T15:55:12-05:00', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'OneNYC_2050_Strategic_Plan.pdf', 'total_pages': 332, 'page': 310, 'page_label': '311'}, page_content='11   |   O neNYC 2050 : MODERN INFRASTRUCTURE\\nNYC.GOV/O neNYC\\n• IMPROVE COOPERATION WITH UTILITIES FOR LONG-TERM \\nPLANNING  \\nNew York City’s infrastructure depends on the multiple public \\nand private utilities that provide essential services to the city. \\nAs the City maintains, replaces, and upgrades its water, sewer, \\nand roadway networks, it must coordinate with the nearby \\nelectric, steam, gas, and telecommunications networks.

In 2019, the City \\nwill issue the first Internet Master Plan in the nation, detailing \\nthe current state of New York City’s broadband infrastructure \\nand establishing clear metrics for what it will need to achieve \\nuniversal, equitable service. The plan will address fixed \\nconnections, mobile service, free public Wi-Fi, and public \\ncomputer centers. It will establish measurable benchmarks \\nfor improving broadband infrastructure for fixed and mobile \\nconnections, assess strategies specific to the conditions of \\nevery neighborhood in the city, and provide the tools needed \\nto prioritize and measure the impact of new public and private \\ninvestment and other actions.

DDC’s A Strategic \\nBlueprint for Construction Excellence provides a thoughtful framework \\nfor improving capital-project delivery at the agency — the successful \\nimplementation of which should be emulated across the City. \\nANTICIPATE MAINTENANCE NEEDS AND MAKE \\nSMART REPAIRS \\n \\nThe fiscal crisis of the 1970s clearly demonstrated the risks \\nassociated with deferred maintenance. By neglecting asset \\nmanagement, the City would have to contend with crumbling \\ninfrastructure and higher costs in the long run. The modern \\napproach New York City employs today reflects the need \\nfor constant assessment and maintenance. By anticipating \\ninfrastructure needs and making smart repairs, the City can \\npreempt the need for the costlier capital projects that would \\notherwise be necessary to replace failing assets. \\n• ACHIEVE A STATE OF GOOD REPAIR  \\nThe most recent Preliminary Ten Year Capital Strategy dedicates \\n55 percent of planned spending to achieving a state of good \\nrepair. This money will go toward repairing and rehabilitating \\nassets, allowing the City to lengthen their service life and reap \\nthe full benefits of investments made in new assets many years \\nago.

However, these \\nassessments must be made more robust in order to capture all \\nthe critical information required for project scoping — much like \\nthe assessments the School Construction Authority performs \\nannually on its own assets. To this end, DDC will expand its \\nasset surveys to 800 inspections per year. At the same time, it will \\nmake a subset of the assessments more actionable by enhancing \\nbuilding condition surveys to be used by sponsor agencies for \\ncapital project prioritization and initial scoping.  \\n \\nThe City, through DOT, remains committed to vigilant, \\nproactive asset management, best demonstrated through its \\nstewardship of the bridges and routine in-depth condition \\nassessments. Recent assessments have led to investments \\nto rehabilitate the iconic East River bridges, DOT has also \\nperformed assessments on the Brooklyn, Manhattan, and \\nQueensboro bridges, including analyzing the Brooklyn Bridge’s \\ncapacity to carry an expanded bike and pedestrian pathway. \\nDOT also plans to explore new technology for real-time \\nmonitoring of individual bridges and tunnel components. By \\ncombining component-level condition data with work histories, \\nDOT will be better able to improve its understanding of \\ndeterioration rates and asset life cycles, allowing for timely and \\nspecific interventions to keep the City’s bridges and tunnels in a \\nstate of good repair. \\n \\nThe Department of Parks and Recreation (Parks) has also \\nexpanded its asset condition assessments, first focusing on \\nfour pilot asset types: synthetic turf fields, retaining walls, \\nrecreation centers, and comfort stations.

The City will devote more \\nresources to scoping projects upfront, streamline procurement, \\nfix burdensome regulations, implement best practices, and deepen \\npublic accountability. Additionally, regulations at the State level \\nmust be changed to give the City more tools at its discretion, and \\nunlock efficiencies throughout the capital process.\\n• IMPROVE PROJECT SCOPING \\nBy properly scoping projects early in the capital process, risks can \\nbe identified ahead of time to avoid schedule delays and costly \\nchange orders. Unexpected field conditions frequently change the \\nscope of a project already in construction. The City’s expansion \\nof predesign site testing and front-end planning can allow for \\nboth better budgeting and designers to plan for known risks and \\nproperly coordinate with utilities. At the same time, an improved \\nchange order management system will help minimize the financial \\nand scheduling impacts of these occurrences.  \\n \\nFeatured in DDC’s Strategic Blueprint, the Front End Planning \\nunits perform an early review of project proposals with sponsor \\nagencies and to ensure goals, budgets, scopes, and schedules all \\nalign. Bringing architectural, engineering, cost estimating, and \\nproject management tools to bear, FEP helps sponsoring agencies \\nunderstand exactly what they are asking for and how much it will \\ncost. The City will ensure the FEP units receive the additional \\nresources necessary to review all projects that come to DDC. \\nFor larger-scale projects, the City manages the Capital Project \\nScope Development (CPSD) Program, which devotes resources \\nto clearly determining project scope, cost, and other key factors \\nbefore they are included in the capital plan. The City has expanded \\nthe program since 2015 and is experimenting with new ways to \\nimprove project scoping and design. \\n• STREAMLINE PROCUREMENT, FIX BURDENSOME OVERSIGHT \\nREQUIREMENTS, AND ADVOCATE FOR REFORMS TO \\nANTIQUATED STATE DELIVERY LIMITATIONS \\nThe Procurement and Sourcing Solutions Portal (PASSPort) \\naims to make procurement easier for both agencies and vendors, \\ntaking a holistic, streamlined approach that incorporates process \\nimprovement, technology, and strong partnerships to achieve \\nsuccess. PASSPort will become the primary platform with which \\nto do business with the City of New York. By streamlining \\nprocurement, and being better able to pay contractors on time, \\nthe City will be a better business partner. The data digitized \\nthrough PASSPort will be invaluable in analyzing the capital \\nportfolio, allowing the City to better understand vendor and \\nagency performance. \\n \\nCertain regulations at the City level slow the procurement process, \\nsignificantly delaying capital projects without meaningfully \\nsolving the problems they were intended to fix. The City will work \\nwith the Council to identify opportunities to reduce unnecessary \\noversight requirements that slow down projects. \\n \\nAlthough the City is improving its capital project delivery, the City \\nis limited in its ability to select the delivery method best suited \\nfor each project. Currently, Design-Bid-Build is the only method \\nallowed to the City across the board, by law. Exceptions have been \\nmade by the State Legislature for large-scale projects such as the \\nBrooklyn-Queens Expressway and Borough-Based Jails System to \\nallow the use of Design-Build, but the City needs to be empowered \\nto select the best method for each project. In addition to Design-\\nBuild, Construction Manager (CM) Build and At-Risk provide new \\nmodels for delivery that can save time and money for the City. New \\nYork City deserves the ability to use Design-Build, a benefit State \\nagencies and the MTA currently possess, which can be granted to \\nthe City at no additional cost to the State. \\n \\nThe City’s construction procurement decisions are also \\nconstrained by General Municipal Law (GML) 103, which requires \\nthe City to accept the lowest responsible, responsive bid in \\nalmost all cases. This law requires the City to award construction \\ncontracts on the basis of price alone and precludes evaluation of \\nthe quality of the bid, past performance by the bidder, and the \\ncontractor’s proposed construction methodology. As a result, \\nwe cannot select the proposal that best meets an agency’s goals \\nand minimizes community impacts. Furthermore, there is no \\nguarantee the lowest bidder will ultimately deliver the project as \\nefficiently, economically, or with equal quality workmanship as a \\ncontractor whose original bid price was higher. Reform to GML-\\n103 would authorize the City to select the contractor whose bid is \\njudged to provide the best overall value to taxpayers on the basis of \\nall of these criteria. \\n• IMPLEMENT PROJECT MANAGEMENT BEST PRACTICES  \\nModernizing capital project delivery requires the City to \\ntake advantage of new approaches to project management, \\nand develop custom-built technology solutions designed for \\nmanaging complex public projects that integrate well with other \\nCity systems. \\n \\nIntegrated project delivery is a project management approach \\nthat maximizes efficiency and ensures accountability. With this \\nmethod, integrated teams with dedicated leadership can take a \\nholistic approach to managing projects by overseeing the project \\nthrough each of the design, procurement, and construction \\nphases. DDC’s project management structure is beginning to \\nutilize these principles, although integrated project delivery \\nmust become more widespread across all City agencies. \\n \\nThese project management teams must be equipped with the \\nnecessary technology systems to be effective.
